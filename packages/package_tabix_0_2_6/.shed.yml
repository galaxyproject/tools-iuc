description: "Tabix: Generic indexer for TAB-delimited genome position files + bgzip"
long_description: |
  Tabix indexes a TAB-delimited genome position file in.tab.bgz and
  creates an index file in.tab.bgz.tbi when region is absent from the command-line.
  The input data file must be position sorted and compressed by bgzip which has a
  gzip(1) like interface. After indexing,

  tabix is able to quickly retrieve data lines overlapping regions specified in the
  format "chr:beginPos-endPos". Fast data retrieval also works over network if URI
  is given as a file name and in this case the index file will be downloaded if it
  is not present locally.
