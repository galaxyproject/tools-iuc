long_description: |
  RMAP is aimed to map accurately reads from the next-generation
  sequencing technology. RMAP can map reads with or without error probability information
  (quality scores) and supports paired-end reads or bisulfite-treated reads mapping.
  There is no limitations on read widths or number of mismatches. RMAP can now map
  more than 8 million reads in an hour at full sensitivity to 2 mismatches.
