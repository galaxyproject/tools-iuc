  Infernal ("INFERence of RNA ALignment") is for searching DNA sequence
  databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities. It is an implementation of
  a special case of profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance models
  (CMs). A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a combination of sequence
  consensus and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases, it is more capable
  of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary structure more than their
  primary sequence.
