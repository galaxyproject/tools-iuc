long_description: 'HISAT is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program.
  As part of HISAT, we have developed a new indexing scheme based on the
  Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the FM index, called hierarchical
  indexing, that employs two types of indexes: (1) one global FM index
  representing the whole genome, and (2) many separate local FM indexes for
  small regions collectively covering the genome. Our hierarchical index
  for the human genome (about 3 billion bp) includes ~48,000 local FM
  indexes, each representing a genomic region of ~64,000bp. As the basis
  for non-gapped alignment, the FM index is extremely fast with a low
  memory footprint, as demonstrated by Bowtie. In addition, HISAT provides
  several alignment strategies specifically designed for mapping different
  types of RNA-seq reads. All these together, HISAT enables extremely fast
  and sensitive alignment of reads, in particular those spanning two exons
  or more. As a result, HISAT is much faster >50 times than TopHat2 with
  better alignment quality. Although it uses a large number of indexes, the
  memory requirement of HISAT is still modest, approximately 4.3 GB for
  human. HISAT uses the Bowtie2 implementation to handle most of the
  operations on the FM index. In addition to spliced alignment, HISAT
  handles reads involving indels and supports a paired-end alignment
  mode. Multiple processors can be used simultaneously to achieve greater
  alignment speed. HISAT outputs alignments in SAM format, enabling
  interoperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. SAMtools, GATK)
  that use SAM. HISAT is distributed under the GPLv3 license, and it runs
  on the command line under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.'
