        <readme>HISAT is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program. As part of HISAT, we have developed a new indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the FM index, called hierarchical indexing, that employs two types of indexes: (1) one global FM index representing the whole genome, and (2) many separate local FM indexes for small regions collectively covering the genome. Our hierarchical index for the human genome (about 3 billion bp) includes ~48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ~64,000bp. As the basis for non-gapped alignment, the FM index is extremely fast with a low memory footprint, as demonstrated by Bowtie. In addition, HISAT provides several alignment strategies specifically designed for mapping different types of RNA-seq reads. All these together, HISAT enables extremely fast and sensitive alignment of reads, in particular those spanning two exons or more. As a result, HISAT is much faster >50 times than TopHat2 with better alignment quality. Although it uses a large number of indexes, the memory requirement of HISAT is still modest, approximately 4.3 GB for human. HISAT uses the Bowtie2 implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index. In addition to spliced alignment, HISAT handles reads involving indels and supports a paired-end alignment mode. Multiple processors can be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed. HISAT outputs alignments in SAM format, enabling interoperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. SAMtools, GATK) that use SAM. HISAT is distributed under the GPLv3 license, and it runs on the command line under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</readme>
