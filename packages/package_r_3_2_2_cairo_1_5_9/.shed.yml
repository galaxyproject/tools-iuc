description: Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version
  1.5-9 of the Cairo R graphics device. This depends on system cairo, which can be installed
  with package_cairo_1_12_14
long_description: |
  Cairo graphics device that can be use to create high-quality vector (PDF, PostScript and SVG)
  and bitmap output (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality rendering in displays (X11 and Win32).
  Since it uses the same back-end for all output, copying across formats is WYSIWYG. 
  Files are created without the dependence on X11 or other external programs. 
  This device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent drawing) and resulting images can
  contain transparent and semi-transparent regions. It is ideal for use in server environments 
  (file output) and as a replacement for other devices that don't have Cairo's capabilities such 
  as alpha support or anti-aliasing. Backends are modular such that any subset of backends is supported.
