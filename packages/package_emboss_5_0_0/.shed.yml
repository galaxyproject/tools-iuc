  EMBOSS is "The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite".
  EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for the
  needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software automatically
  copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows transparent retrieval of
  sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the package,
  it is a platform to allow other scientists to develop and release software in true
  open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently available packages
  and tools for sequence analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical
  trend towards commercial software packages.
