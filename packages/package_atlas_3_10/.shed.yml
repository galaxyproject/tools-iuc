  The ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) project
  is an ongoing research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in order
  to provide portable performance. At present, it provides C and Fortran77 interfaces
  to a portably efficient BLAS implementation, as well as a few routines from LAPACK.
