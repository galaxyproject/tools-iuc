  LibPNG supports almost all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for
  over 20 years. The home site for development versions (i.e., may be buggy or subject
  to change or include experimental features) is http://libpng.sourceforge.net/, and
  the place to go for questions about the library is the png-mng-implement mailing list.
