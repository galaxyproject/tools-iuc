long_description: |
  MACS analyzes data generated by short read sequencers such as Solexa''s
  Genome Analyzer. MACS empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags, and uses
  it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. MACS also uses
  a dynamic Poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome,
  allowing for more robust predictions.
