description: Package containing python bindings to gnuplot
long_description: |
  Gnuplot.py is a Python package that interfaces to gnuplot, the popular
  open-source plotting program. It allows you to use gnuplot from within Python
  to plot arrays of data from memory, data files, or mathematical functions. If
  you use Python to perform computations or as "glue" for numerical programs,
  you can use this package to plot data on the fly as they are computed. And
  the combination with Python makes it is easy to automate things, including to
  create crude "animations" by plotting different datasets one after another.
