description: Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version
  2.0.6 of the pathoscope python library.
long_description: |
  Pathoscope 2.0 consists of four core and two optional analysis modules for
  sequencing-based metagenomic profiling. The PathoLib module extracts genome
  reference libraries (target or host/filter) from all available sequences in
  the NCBI Nucleotide database that belong to a user-defined taxonomic clade.
  The PathoMap module aligns the reads to the target reference library and
  removes any reads that have sequence similarity with the host or filter
  genomes. PathoID resolves read ambiguity, identifies which of the target
  genomes are present in the sample and estimates the proportions of reads
  originating from each genome. PathoReport provides two report files: 1) a
  summary report (.tsv) that contains the numbers and proportions of reads
  aligned to each genome identified in the sample, and 2) detailed report (.xml)
  including read coverage, read assignments, and contiguous sequences generated
  by combining the reads. The PathoDB is an optional module that provides
  additional annotation (organism taxonomic lineage, gene loci, protein products)
  for all sequences identified in the sample. The PathoQC module can be used to
  preprocess the reads prior to alignment with PathoMap.
