long_description: 'HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation
  sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) against the general human population (as well as against
  a single reference genome). Based on an extension of BWT for graphs [Sirén et al. 2014],
  we designed and implemented a graph FM index (GFM), an original approach and its first
  implementation to the best of our knowledge. In addition to using one global GFM index that
  represents the general population, HISAT2 uses a large set of small GFM indexes that
  collectively cover the whole genome (each index representing a genomic region of 56 Kbp,
  with 55,000 indexes needed to cover the human population). These small indexes (called
  local indexes), combined with several alignment strategies, enable rapid and accurate
  alignment of sequencing reads. This new indexing scheme is called a Hierarchical Graph
  FM index (HGFM).'
