  GEMINI (GEnome MINIng) is designed to be a flexible framework for
  exploring genetic variation in the context of the wealth of genome annotations available
  for the human genome. By placing genetic variants, sample genotypes, and useful
  genome annotations into an integrated database framework, GEMINI provides a simple,
  flexible, yet very powerful system for exploring genetic variation for for disease
  and population genetics.

  Using the GEMINI framework begins by loading a VCF file into a database. Each variant
  is automatically annotated by comparing it to several genome annotations from source
  such as ENCODE tracks, UCSC tracks, OMIM, dbSNP, KEGG, and HPRD. All of this information
  is stored in portable SQLite database that allows one to explore and interpret both
  coding and non-coding variation using "off-the-shelf" tools or an enhanced SQL engine.
