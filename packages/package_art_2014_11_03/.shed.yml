  ART is a set of simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation
  sequencing reads. ART simulates sequencing reads by mimicking real sequencing
  process with empirical error models or quality profiles summarized from large
  recalibrated sequencing data. ART can also simulate reads using user own read
  error model or quality profiles. ART supports simulation of single-end,
  paired-end/mate-pair reads of three major commercial next-generation sequencing
  platforms; Illumina's Solexa, Roche's 454 and Applied Biosystems' SOLiD. ART
  can be used to test or benchmark a variety of method or tools for
  next-generation sequencing data analysis, including read alignment, de novo
  assembly, SNP and structure variation discovery. ART was used as a primary
  tool for the simulation study of the 1000 Genomes Project . ART is
  implemented in C++ with optimized algorithms and is highly efficient in read
  simulation. ART outputs reads in the FASTQ format, and alignments in the ALN
  format. ART can also generate alignments in the SAM alignment or UCSC BED
  file format.
