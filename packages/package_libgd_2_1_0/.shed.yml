long_description: |
  GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images
  by programmers. GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are available for Perl, PHP and
  other languages. GD creates PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, XPM, BMP images, among other formats.
  GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails, and most anything
  else, on the fly. While not restricted to use on the web, the most common applications
  of GD involve website development.
