  Lapels is used to remap in silico (pseudo) genome alignments, in
  the form of a BAM file, back to the reference sequence. This entails the removal
  of all indels (via the cigar string modifications, the underlying sequence is unaltered)
  and adjustment fragment and mate starting positions. Lapels also annotates the number
  and types (SNPs, insertions, and deletions) of allele variants seen in each read.
