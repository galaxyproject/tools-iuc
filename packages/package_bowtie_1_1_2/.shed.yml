  Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner. It
  aligns short DNA sequences (reads) to the human genome at a rate of over 25 million
  35-bp reads per hour. Bowtie indexes the genome with a Burrows-Wheeler index to
  keep its memory footprint small: typically about 2.2 GB for the human genome (2.9
  GB for paired-end).
