long_description: |
  GMAP is a genomic mapping and alignment program for mRNA and EST sequences.  
  GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), 
  can align both single-end and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and 
  of arbitrarily long length.  
  It can detect short-distance and long-distance splicing, including 
  interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models
  or a database of known splice sites.  The program also permits SNP-tolerant 
  alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of 
  major and minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA 
  for the study of methylation state.
