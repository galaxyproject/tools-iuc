  GMAP is a genomic mapping and alignment program for mRNA and EST sequences.
  GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), can align both
  single-end and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of arbitrarily long
  length. It can detect short-distance and long-distance splicing, including
  interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models
  or a database of known splice sites.  The program also permits SNP-tolerant
  alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and
  minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA for the study
  of methylation state.
