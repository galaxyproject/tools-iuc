long_description: |
  GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using
  one or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small script that has
  to be run for each of the lines in the input. The typical input is a list of files,
  a list of hosts, a list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can
  also be a command that reads from a pipe. GNU parallel can then split the input
  and pipe it into commands in parallel.
