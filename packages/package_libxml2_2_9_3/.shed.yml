long_description: |
  Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project (but usable outside of the Gnome
  platform), it is free software available under the MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup
  languages, i.e. text language where semantic and structure are added to the content using extra "markup"
  information enclosed between angle brackets. HTML is the most well-known markup language. Though the library
  is written in C a variety of language bindings make it available in other environments.
