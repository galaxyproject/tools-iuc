<![CDATA[
RNAstructure is a complete package for RNA and DNA secondary structure
prediction and analysis. It includes algorithms for   secondary structure
prediction, including facility to predict base pairing probabilities. It
also can be used to predict bimolecular structures and can predict the
equilibrium binding affinity of an oligonucleotide to a structured RNA
target. This is useful for siRNA design. It can also predict secondary
structures common to two, unaligned sequences, which is much more accurate
than single sequence secondary structure prediction. Finally, RNAstructure
can take a number of different types of experiment mapping data to constrain
or restrain structure prediction. These include chemical mapping, enzymatic
mapping, NMR, and SHAPE data.
