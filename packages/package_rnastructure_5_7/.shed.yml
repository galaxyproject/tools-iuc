long_description: 
  'RNAstructure is a complete package for RNA and DNA secondary structure 
  prediction and analysis. It includes algorithms for   secondary structure 
  prediction, including facility to predict base pairing probabilities. It 
  also can be used to predict bimolecular structures and can predict the 
  equilibrium binding affinity of an oligonucleotide to a structured RNA 
  target. This is useful for siRNA design. It can also predict secondary 
  structures common to two, unaligned sequences, which is much more accurate 
  than single sequence secondary structure prediction. Finally, RNAstructure 
  can take a number of different types of experiment mapping data to constrain 
  or restrain structure prediction. These include chemical mapping, enzymatic 
  mapping, NMR, and SHAPE data.'
