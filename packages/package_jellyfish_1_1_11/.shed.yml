long_description: 'JELLYFISH is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in DNA.
  A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences of all such substrings is
  a central step in many analyses of DNA sequence. JELLYFISH can count k-mers using an order
  of magnitude less memory and an order of magnitude faster than other k-mer counting packages
  by using an efficient encoding of a hash table and by exploiting the "compare-and-swap"
  CPU instruction to increase parallelism.'
