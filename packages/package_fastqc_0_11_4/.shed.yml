  FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control
  checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It
  provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression
  of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing
  any further analysis.
