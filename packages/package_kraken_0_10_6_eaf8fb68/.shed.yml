long_description: 'Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short
  DNA sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous
  attempts by other bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have often
  used sequence alignment or machine learning techniques that were quite slow,
  leading to the development of less sensitive but much faster abundance
  estimation programs. Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity and high speed
  by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.'
