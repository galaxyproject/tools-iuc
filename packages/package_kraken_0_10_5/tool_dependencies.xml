<![CDATA[
Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, usually obtained
through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other bioinformatics software to accomplish
this task have often used sequence alignment or machine learning techniques that were quite
slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but much faster abundance estimation programs.
Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers
and a novel classification algorithm.
