long_description: |
  Homer contains a useful, all-in-one program for performing peak
  annotation called annotatePeaks.pl.  In addition to associating peaks with nearby
  genes, annotatePeaks.pl can perform Gene Ontology Analysis, genomic feature association
  analysis (Genome Ontology), associate peaks with gene expression data, calculate
  ChIP-Seq Tag densities from different experiments, and find motif occurrences in
  peaks.
