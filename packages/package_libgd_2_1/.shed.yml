  GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images by
  programmers. GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are available for Perl, PHP
  and other languages. GD creates PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, XPM, BMP images, among
  other formats. GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails,
  and most anything else, on the fly. While not restricted to use on the web,
  the most common applications of GD involve website development.
