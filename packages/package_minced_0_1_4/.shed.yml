description: MinCED - Mining CRISPRs in Environmental Datasets
long_description: |
  MinCED is a program to find Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
  Repeats (CRISPRs) in full genomes or environmental datasets such as
  metagenomes, in which sequence size can be anywhere from 100 to 800 bp.
  MinCED runs from the command-line and was derived from CRT

  (CRT): a tool for automatic detection of clustered regularly interspaced
  palindromic repeats, BMC

  Bioinformatics 8, no. 1 (2007): 209.
