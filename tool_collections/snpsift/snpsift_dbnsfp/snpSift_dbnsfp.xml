The dbNSFP database is available from https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP and there is only annotation for human genome builds.

The procedure for preparing the dbNSFP data for use in SnpSift dbnsfp and a couple of prebuilt dbNSFP databases are available at:
http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpSift.html#dbNSFP

However, any dbNSFP-like tabular file that be can used with SnpSift dbnsfp if it has:

- The first line of the file must be column headers that name the annotations.
- The first 4 columns are required and must be:

  1. chr: chromosome
  2. pos(1-coor): position in chromosome
  3. ref: reference base
  4. alt: alternate base

For example::

    #chr	pos(1-coor)	ref	alt	aaref	aaalt	genename	SIFT_score
    1	69134	A	C	E	A	OR4F5	0.03
    1	69134	A	G	E	G	OR4F5	0.09
    1	69134	A	T	E	V	OR4F5	0.03
    4	100239319	T	A	H	L	ADH1B	0
    4	100239319	T	C	H	R	ADH1B	0.15
    4	100239319	T	G	H	P	ADH1B	0

The Galaxy datatypes for dbNSFP can automatically convert the specially formatted tabular file for use by SnpSift dbNSFP:

1. Upload the tabular file, set the datatype as: **"dbnsfp.tabular"**
2. Edit the history dataset attributes (pencil icon): Use "Convert Format" to convert the **"dbnsfp.tabular"** to the correct format for SnpSift dbnsfp: **"snpsiftdbnsfp"**.
