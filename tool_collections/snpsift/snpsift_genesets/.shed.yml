description: Annotate SnpEff vcf with genesets such as Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, Reactome
long_description: |
  Gene set annotations, such as Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, Reactome, etc., 
  can be added to a SnpEff annotated file using SnpSift geneSets command. 
  The VCF file must be annotated using SnpEff before perforimg Gene Sets annotations. 
  This is because we must know which gene the variant affects).
