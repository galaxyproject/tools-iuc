description: snpEff SnpSift dbnsfp tool from Pablo Cingolani
long_description: |
  Annotates variants on genes using the dbNSFP, an integrated database of human
  functional predictions from multiple algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT and
  MutationTaster, PhyloP and GERP++, etc.). This tool determines the available
  annotations from the input, so it can be used for other organisms other than
  human or other annotation values than available from dbNSFP.

  SnpEff and SnpSift are developed by Pablo Cingolani.
