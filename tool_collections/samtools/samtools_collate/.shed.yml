description: Collate alignments by read name.
long_description: |
  samtools collate tool groups alignments with the same read name together.
  Unlike a full name-sorting step, collate is optimized for speed and typically uses
  less memory. It works by shuffling reads into temporary bins and emitting records
  grouped by query name, which is useful for downstream steps that require read pairs
  to be adjacent.
