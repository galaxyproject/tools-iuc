# Tab separated with three columns:
# - value (Galaxy records this in the Galaxy DB)
# - name (Galaxy shows this in the UI)
# - path (folder name containing the Kraken DB)
#
# Modern usage assumes $path is the folder containing
# the Kraken database of interest:
#
new_style_test_entry	"Test Database"	${__HERE__}/test_db

# The kraken wrapper still supports an alternative
# legacy usage where $path/$name is the folder
# containing the Kraken database of interest, meaning
# $name must be both a folder name and human readable
# description of the DB to show in the Galaxy UI:
old_style_test_entry	test_db	${__HERE__}

# NOTE: This legacy style should be avoided as other
# tools also using the kraken_database.loc file may
# not understand it!
