description: Finds reads where a template switch occurred during library construction
long_description: |
  FindSwitchbackReads identifies reads where a template switch occurred during library construction.
  Some library construction methods, notably ultra-low-input shotgun methods, are prone to template
  switching events that create molecules that instead of being a linear copy of a segment of genomic
  DNA, are chimeras formed by starting on one strand of DNA and then switching to the opposite strand.
