description: Manipulate FASTQ reads on various attributes.
long_description: |
  This tool allows you to build complex manipulations to be applied
  to each matching read in a FASTQ file. A read must match all matching directives
  in order for it to be manipulated; if a read does not match, it is output in a non-modified
  manner. All reads matching will have each of the specified manipulations performed
  upon them, in the order specified.
