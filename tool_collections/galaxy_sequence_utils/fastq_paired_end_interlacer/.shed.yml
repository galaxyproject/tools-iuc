description: FASTQ interlacer on paired end reads
long_description: |
  This tool joins paired end FASTQ reads from two separate files,
  one with the left mates and one with the right mates, into a single files where
  left mates alternate with their right mates. The join is performed using sequence
  identifiers, allowing the two files to contain differing ordering. If a sequence
  identifier does not appear in both files, it is included in a separate file.
