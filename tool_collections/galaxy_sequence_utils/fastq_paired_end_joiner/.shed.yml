description: FASTQ joiner on paired end reads
long_description: |
  This tool joins paired end FASTQ reads from two separate files
  into a single read in one file. The join is performed using sequence identifiers,
  allowing the two files to contain differing ordering. If a sequence identifier does
  not appear in both files, it is excluded from the output.
