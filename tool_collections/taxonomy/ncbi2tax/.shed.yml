  ncbi2tax  is designed to translate results of BLAST, Kraken, or Diamond (or anything else that contains NCBI's TaxIds)
  to the full representation of NCBI taxonomy. The output of this tool can be directly visualized by the Krona tool 
  within Galaxy or used in downstream applications. It is based on gb_taxonomy_tools developed by https://github.com/spond.
