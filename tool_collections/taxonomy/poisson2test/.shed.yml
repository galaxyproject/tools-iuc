description: Poisson two-sample test
long_description: |
  Suppose you have metagenomic samples from two different locations
  and have classified the reads unique to various taxa. Now you want to test if the
  number of reads that fall in a particular taxon in location 1 is different from
  those that fall in the same taxon in location 2.

  This utility performs this analysis. It assumes that the data comes from a Poisson
  process and calculates two Z scores (Z1 and Z2) based on the work by Shiue and Bain;
  1982 (Z1) and Huffman; 1984 (Z2).
