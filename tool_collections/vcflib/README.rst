vcflib-tools
============

A collection of Galaxy wrappers for vcflib utilities. This is a
development copy of the tools that exist in the Galaxy Tool Shed
(http://usegalaxy.org/toolshed).

Because vcflib can only be reliably compiled on Linux platforms at this
time these wrappers make this assumption.
