  This tool breaks or creates multiallelic VCF records based on user
  selection.

  - Breaking = If multiple alleles are specified in a single record, break the record
  into multiple lines, preserving allele-specific INFO fields.
  - Creation = If overlapping alleles are represented across multiple records, merge
  them into a single record.
