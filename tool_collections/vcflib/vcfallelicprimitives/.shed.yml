description: Splits alleleic primitives (gaps or mismatches) into multiple VCF lines

long_description: |
  If multiple alleleic primitives (gaps or mismatches) are specified
  in a single VCF record, this tools splits the record into multiple lines, but drops
  all INFO fields.  "Pure" MNPs are split into multiple SNPs unless the -m flag is
  provided.  Genotypes are phased where complex alleles have been decomposed, provided
  genotypes in the input.
