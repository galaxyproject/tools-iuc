long_description: |
  Combines VCF files positionally, combining samples when sites and
  alleles are identical. Any number of VCF files may be combined. The INFO field and
  other columns are taken from one of the files which are combined when records in
  multiple files match. Alleles must have identical ordering to be combined into one
  record. If they do not, multiple records will be emitted.
