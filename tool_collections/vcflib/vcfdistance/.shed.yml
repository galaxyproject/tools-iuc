  Adds a value to each VCF record indicating the distance to the
  nearest variant in the file.     The dataset used as input to this tool must be
  coordinate sorted. This can be achieved by either using the VCFsort utility or Galaxy''s
  general purpose sort tool (in this case sort on the first and the second column
  in ascending order).
