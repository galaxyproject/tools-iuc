# package_minfi_1.15.7

Minfi (for galaxy)
====

The minfi package provides tools for analyzing Illuminaâ€™s Methylation arrays, with a special
focus on the new 450k array for humans. 

In this package we refer to differentially methylated positions (DMPs) by which we mean
a single genomic position that has a different methylation level in two different groups of
samples (or conditions). This is different from differentially methylated regions (DMRs)
which imply more that more than one methylation positions are different between conditions.
