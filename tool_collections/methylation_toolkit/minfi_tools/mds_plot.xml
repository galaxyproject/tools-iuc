**What it does**

After preprocessing the raw data to obtain methylation estimates, Multi-dimensional scaling
(MDS) plots provide a quick way to get a first sense of the relationship between samples.
They are similar to the more familiar PCA plots and display a two-dimensional approximation
of sample-to-sample Euclidean distance. Note that while the plot visualizes the distance
in epigenomic profiles between samples, the absolute positions of the points is not meaningful.
One often expects to see greater between-group than within-group distances (although
this clearly depends on the particular experiment). The most variable locations are used
when calculating sample distances, with the number specified by the numPositions option.
Adding sample labels to the MDS plot is a useful way of identifying outliers (figure 4) that
behave differently from their peers

**Input** :

*rgSet* An object of class RGChannelSet

*numPositions* Use the numPositions genomic positions with the most methylation variability
when calculating distance between samples. (default value is 1000)


**Output**:

*Main title for grpah* Title of the graph
