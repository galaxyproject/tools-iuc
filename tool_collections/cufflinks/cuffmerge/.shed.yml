long_description: |
  Cuffmerge merges together several Cufflinks assemblies and automatically filters a number of transfrags that are
  probably artfifacts. If you have a reference GTF file available, you can provide it to the script in order to gracefully merge 
  novel isoforms and known isoforms and maximize overall assembly quality.
