  Cuffdiff is part of the Cufflinks suite. Cuffdiff find significant changes in transcript
  expression, splicing, and promoter use. Cuffdiff takes a GTF2/GFF3 file of transcripts
  as input, along with two or more SAM files containing the fragment alignments for two or
  more samples. It produces a number of output files that contain test results for changes
  in expression at the level of transcripts, primary transcripts, and genes. It also tracks
  changes in the relative abundance of transcripts sharing a common transcription start
  site, and in the relative abundances of the primary transcripts of each gene. Tracking
  the former allows one to see changes in splicing, and the latter lets one see changes
  in relative promoter use within a gene.
