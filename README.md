Galaxy Tools maintained by IUC
==============================

![](iuc_logo.png)

This repo contains a subset of Galaxy repositories used in the Tool Shed (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).

These repositories are maintained and developed by the [Intergalactic Utilities Commission](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/) ([Github Org](https://github.com/galaxy-iuc/))

Pull Requests with dependencies specified as conda-package will be automatically tested and verified using [planemo](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo). If the tests pass and the pull request is merged, the tool will be automatically uploaded to the [Test](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)- and [Main Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).

Please note, if you don’t want to run the tests or the automatic upload, add `[ci skip]` to the git commit message.
Commits that have [ci skip] anywhere in the commit messages are ignored by Travis CI.
