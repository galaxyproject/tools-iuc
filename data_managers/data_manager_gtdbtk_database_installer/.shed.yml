homepage_url: https://github.com/Ecogenomics/GTDBTk
long_description: Installs the selected version of the GTDB-Tk database, associating it with the gtdbtk_database data table.  GTDB-Tk is a software toolkit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomes based on the Genome Database Taxonomy GTDB. It is designed to work with recent advances that allow hundreds or thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. It can also be applied to isolate and single-cell genomes.  The GTDB-Tk is open source and released under the GNU General Public License (Version 3).
