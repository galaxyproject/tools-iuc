description: Install packages of genome annotation data from yaml specifications
long_description: |
    This tool fetches and installs packages of genome annotation datasets that
    are not tightly bound to specific tools, but generic enough to be of use
    for many different tools. The annotation sources to be installed are
    specified via a yaml file passed to the data manager.
