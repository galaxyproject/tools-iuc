# This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
# to use a selected PIMA plasmids_and_vectors.fasta file.  The pima_pv.loc
# file has this format (longer white space characters are TAB characters):
#
# <version> <display_name> <directory_path>
#
# So, for example, if you have the plasmids_and_vectors.fasta files stored in 
# /depot/data2/galaxy/pima_pv/, 
# then the pima_pv.loc entry would look like this:
#
# 2022-10-18	PIMA plasmids_and_vectors.fasta	/depot/data2/galaxy/pima_pv
2022-10-18   2022-10-18 plasmids_and_vectors.fasta    ${__HERE__}
