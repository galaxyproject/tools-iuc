#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
#to use a directory of 2bit genome files for use with Lastz. You will
#need to supply these files and then create a lastz_seqs.loc file
#similar to this one (store it in this directory) that points to
#the directories in which those files are stored. The lastz_seqs.loc
#file has this format (white space characters are TAB characters):
#
#<unique_build_id>	<display_name>		<file_path>
#
#So, for example, if your lastz_seqs.loc began like this:
#
#hg18	Human (Homo sapiens): hg18		/depot/data2/galaxy/twobit/hg18.2bit
#hg19	Human (Homo sapiens): hg19		/depot/data2/galaxy/twobit/hg19.2bit
#mm9	Mouse (Mus musculus): mm9		/depot/data2/galaxy/twobit/mm9.2bit
#
#then your /depot/data2/galaxy/twobit/ directory
#would need to contain the following 2bit files:
#
#-rw-r--r--  1 james    universe 830134 2005-09-13 10:12 hg18.2bit
#-rw-r--r--  1 james    universe 527388 2005-09-13 10:12 hg19.2bit
#-rw-r--r--  1 james    universe 269808 2005-09-13 10:12 mm9.2bit
#
#Your lastz_seqs.loc file should include an entry per line for
#each file you have stored that you want to be available. Note that
#your files should all have the extension '2bit'.
#
#Note that for backwards compatibility with workflows, the unique ID of
#an entry must be the path that was in the original loc file, because that
#is the value stored in the workflow for that parameter.
