long_description: |
    HUMAnN is a pipeline for efficiently and accurately profiling the presence/absence and abundance of microbial pathways 
    in a community from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing data (typically millions of short DNA/RNA reads). 
    This process, referred to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential of a microbial community 
    and its members. More generally, functional profiling answers the question "What are the microbes in my community-of-interest 
    doing (or capable of doing)?"
