If Galaxy is configured such that outputs are written to the job working dir
the admin needs to perform one manual step to make the databases useable. 
This is because DRAM creates a configuration file during installation, but the
file is written before the Galaxy job finishes, so the database locations are
relative to the job working directory instead of the configured
GALAXY_DATA_MANAGER_DATA_PATH.

It may be more ideal to perform this task as a second step in the data manager
tool, but DRAM will not allow the configuration file to be updated to point to
locations unless the databases exist in those locations.  But the data manager
tool moves the databases to these locations as its last step, making it
impossible to update the DRAM configuration file as a second step of that tool.
