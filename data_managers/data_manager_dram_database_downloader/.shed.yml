long_description: |
  DRAM (Distilled and Refined Annotation of Metabolism) is a tool for annotating metagenomic assembled genomes
  and VirSorter identified viral contigs. DRAM annotates MAGs and viral contigs using UniRef90, PFAM, dbCAN,
  RefSeq viral, VOGDB and the MEROPS peptidase database as well as custom user databases. DRAM is run in two
  stages. First an annotation step to assign database identifiers to genes and then a distill step to curate
  these annotations into useful functional categories. Additionally, viral contigs are further analyzed to
  identify potential AMGs. This is done via assigning an auxiliary score and flags representing the confidence
  that a gene is both metabolic and viral.
