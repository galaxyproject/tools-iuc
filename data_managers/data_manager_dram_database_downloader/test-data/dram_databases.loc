# This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
# to use a directory of DRAM databases.  The dram_databases.loc
# file has this format (longer white space characters are TAB characters):
#
# <db_version> <display_name> <directory_path>
#
# So, for example, if you have the DRAM databases stored in 
# /depot/data2/galaxy/dram/, 
# then the gtdbtk_databases.loc entry would look like this:
#
# 3.5.1	DRAM database	/depot/data2/galaxy/dram
3.5.1   DRAM 3.5.1 databases    ${__HERE__}
