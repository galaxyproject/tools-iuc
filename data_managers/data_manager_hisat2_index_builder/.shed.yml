description: HISAT is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program.
long_description: |
  As part of HISAT, we have developed a new indexing scheme based on
  the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the FM index, called
  hierarchical indexing, that employs two types of indexes: (1)
  one global FM index representing the whole genome, and (2) many
  separate local FM indexes for small regions collectively covering
  the genome. Our hierarchical index for the human genome (about 3
  billion bp) includes ~48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a
  genomic region of ~64,000bp. As the basis for non-gapped alignment,
  the FM index is extremely fast with a low memory footprint, as
  demonstrated by Bowtie. In addition, HISAT provides several alignment
  strategies specifically designed for mapping different types of
  RNA-seq reads. All these together, HISAT enables extremely fast and
  sensitive alignment of reads, in particular those spanning two exons
  or more. As a result, HISAT is much faster >50 times than TopHat2
  with better alignment quality. Although it uses a large number of
  indexes, the memory requirement of HISAT is still modest,
  approximately 4.3 GB for human. HISAT uses the Bowtie2
  implementation to handle most of the operations on the FM index.
  In addition to spliced alignment, HISAT handles reads involving
  indels and supports a paired-end alignment mode. Multiple processor
  can be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed.
  HISAT outputs alignments in SAM format, enabling interoperation
  with a large number of other tools (e.g. SAMtools, GATK) that use
  SAM. HISAT is distributed under the GPLv3 license, and it runs on
  the command line under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
