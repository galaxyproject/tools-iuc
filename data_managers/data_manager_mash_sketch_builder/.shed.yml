  Mash extends the MinHash dimensionality-reduction technique to include
  a pairwise mutation distance and P value significance test, enabling the
  efficient clustering and search of massive sequence collections. Mash
  reduces large sequences and sequence sets to small, representative sketches,
  from which global mutation distances can be rapidly estimated.
