description: Contig Annotation Tool (CAT) Data Manager
long_description: Contig Annotation Tool (CAT) and Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) are pipelines
  for the taxonomic classification of long DNA sequences and metagenome assembled
  genomes (MAGs/bins) of both known and (highly) unknown microorganisms, as generated
  by contemporary metagenomics studies. This data manager installs reference data 
  used by these applications.
  A reference data set requires about 250GB of disk space.
