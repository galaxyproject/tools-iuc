description: Pre-generate indexes for kallisto

long_description: |
  kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq
  data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput sequencing
  reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly
  determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for
  alignment. On benchmarks with standard RNA-Seq data, kallisto can quantify 30
  million human reads in less than 3 minutes on a Mac desktop computer using
  only the read sequences and a transcriptome index that itself takes less than
  10 minutes to build. Pseudoalignment of reads preserves the key information
  needed for quantification, and kallisto is therefore not only fast, but also
  as accurate as existing quantification tools. In fact, because the
  pseudoalignment procedure is robust to errors in the reads, in many benchmarks
  kallisto significantly outperforms existing tools.
