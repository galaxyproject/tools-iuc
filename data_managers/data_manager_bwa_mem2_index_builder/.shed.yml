  Bwa-mem2 is the next version of the bwa-mem algorithm in bwa. It produces 
  alignment identical to bwa and is ~1.3-3.1x faster depending on the use-case, 
  dataset and the running machine. Bwa-mem2 uses a different index format that
  is efficient on disk space and runtime memory but requires larger amounts of
  memory (roughly 27x the reference) when building.
