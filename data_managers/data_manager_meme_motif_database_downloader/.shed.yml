  Motif database downloader for the MEME Suite, which allows the biologist to discover novel motifs in collections
  of unaligned nucleotide or protein sequences, and to perform a wide variety of other motif-based analyses.

  Motif database downloader for the MEME Suite, which supports motif-based analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences.
  It provides motif discovery algorithms using both probabilistic (MEME) and discrete models (MEME), which have
  complementary strengths.  It also allows discovery of motifs with arbitrary insertions and deletions (GLAM2).
  In addition to motif discovery, the MEME Suite provides tools for scanning sequences for matches to motifs (FIMO,
  MAST and GLAM2Scan), scanning for clusters of motifs (MCAST), comparing motifs to known motifs (Tomtom), finding
  preferred spacings between motifs (SpaMo), predicting the biological roles of motifs (GOMo), measuring the positional
  enrichment of sequences for known motifs (CentriMo), and analyzing ChIP-seq and other large datasets (MEME-ChIP).
  The MEME Suite is comprised of a collection of tools that work together.
