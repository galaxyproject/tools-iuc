**What it does**

It allows one to screen for overlaps between two sets of genomic features. Moreover, it allows one to have
fine control as to how the intersections are reported. intersectBed works with both BED/GFF/VCF
and BAM files as input.
Example usage would be to cull a BAM file from an exome capture experiment to include on the "on-target" alignments. 

.. class:: infomark

Note that each BAM alignment is treated individually. Therefore, if one end of a paired-end alignment overlaps an interval in the BED file, yet the other end does not, the output file will only include the overlapping end.

.. class:: infomark

Note that a BAM alignment will be sent to the output file **once** even if it overlaps more than one interval in the BED file.
