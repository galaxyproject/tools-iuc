description: Remove PCR duplicates
long_description: |
  This tool uses the SAMtools toolkit to remove potential PCR duplicates:
  if multiple read pairs have identical external coordinates, only retain the pair
  with highest mapping quality. In the paired-end mode, this command ONLY works with
  FR orientation and requires ISIZE is correctly set. It does not work for unpaired
  reads (e.g. two ends mapped to different chromosomes or orphan reads).
