long_description: |
  ONTO-PERL a collection of PERL modules for dealing with OBO-formatted
  ontologies (like the Gene Ontology). This code distribution gathers
  object-oriented modules (for dealing with ontology elements such as Term,
  Relationship and so forth), scripts (for typical tasks such as format
  conversions; obo2owl, owl2obo; besides, there are also many examples that can
  be easily adapted for specific applications), and a set of test files to
  ensure the suite's implementation quality.
