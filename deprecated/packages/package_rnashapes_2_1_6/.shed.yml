description: Provides RNAshape 2.1.6
long_description: |
  RNAshape abstraction maps structures to a tree-like domain of shapes,
  retaining adjacency and nesting of structural features, but disregarding
  helix lengths. Shape abstraction integrates well with dynamic programming
  algorithms, and hence it can be applied during structure prediction rather
  than afterwards. This avoids exponential explosion and can still give us a
  non-heuristic and complete account of properties of the molecule's folding
  space.
