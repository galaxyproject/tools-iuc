  Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in
  fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
  The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.
