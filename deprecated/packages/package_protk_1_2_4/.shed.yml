  tools. The following analysis tasks are currently supported;

  * Tandem MS search with X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA and MS-GF+
  * Peptide and Protein inference with Peptide Prophet, iProphet and Protein Prophet
  * Conversion of pepXML or protXML to tabulular format
  * Proteogenomics (mapping peptides to genomic coordinates)
