  Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project (but
  usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software available under
  the MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup languages,
  i.e. text language where semantic and structure are added to the content
  using extra "markup" information enclosed between angle brackets. HTML is
  the most well-known markup language. Though the library is written in C a
  variety of language bindings make it available in other environments.
