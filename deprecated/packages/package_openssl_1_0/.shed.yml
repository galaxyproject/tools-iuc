  The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
  commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure
  Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well
  as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

  The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet
  to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation.
