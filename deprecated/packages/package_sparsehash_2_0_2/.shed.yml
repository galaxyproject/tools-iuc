description: Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version 2.0.2 of sparsehash.
long_description: |
  An extremely memory-efficient hash_map implementation. 2 bits/entry overhead! The SparseHash library contains several hash-map implementations, including implementations that optimize for space or speed.

  These hashtable implementations are similar in API to SGI's hash_map class and the tr1 unordered_map class, but with different performance characteristics. It's easy to replace hash_map or unordered_map by sparse_hash_map or dense_hash_map in C++ code.

  They also contain code to serialize and unserialize from disk.
