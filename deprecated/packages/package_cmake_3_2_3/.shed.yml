  CMake, the cross-platform, open-source build system. CMake is a family
  of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used
  to control the software compilation process using simple platform and
  compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native
  makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment
  of your choice.
