long_description: |
  grabix leverages the fantastic BGZF library in samtools to provide
  random access into text files that have been compressed with bgzip. grabix creates
  it's own index (.gbi) of the bgzipped file. Once indexed, one can extract arbitrary
  lines from the file with the grab command.
