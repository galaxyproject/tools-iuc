description: Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version
  2.5.2 of the freetype font library. Don't use this one.
long_description: |
  Don't use this one in your dependencies, it is only to workaround a matplotlib build issue.

  FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

  It is written in C, designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and portable
  while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most vector and
  bitmap font formats.

  Special package for matplotlib 1.4 to workaround this issue: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/5578
