  This is package dependency for tools relying on VCFlib toolkit developed by
  Erik Garrison (https://github.com/ekg/vcflib). This package is distributed as
  x86_64 binaries only as it is difficult to compile on other platforms. These
  binaries should work on any of our stated supported linux platforms other
  than RHEL/CentOS 5.
