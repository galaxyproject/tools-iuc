description: Contains a tool dependency definition that downloads and compiles version 0.9.6 of PEAR
long_description: |
  PEAR evaluates all possible paired-end read overlaps and without requiring the
  target fragment size as input. In addition, it implements a statistical test
  for minimizing false-positive results. Together with a highly optimized
  implementation, it can merge millions of paired end reads within a couple of
  minutes on a standard desktop computer.
