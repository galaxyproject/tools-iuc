  UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip
  format (also called "zipfiles"). Although highly compatible both with PKWARE's
  PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our
  primary objectives have been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.
