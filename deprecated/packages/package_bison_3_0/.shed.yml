long_description: |
  Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated
  context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing
  LALR(1) parser tables. As an experimental feature, Bison can also generate IELR(1)
  or canonical LR(1) parser tables.

  Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop a wide range of language
  parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.
