long_description: |
  Monocle performs differential expression and time-series analysis for
  single-cell expression experiments. It orders individual cells according to
  progress through a biological process, without knowing ahead of time which
  genes define progress through that process. Monocle also performs
  differential expression analysis, clustering, visualization, and other useful
  tasks on single cell expression data. It is designed to work with RNA-Seq and
  qPCR data, but could be used with other types as well.
