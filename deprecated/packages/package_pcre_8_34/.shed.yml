  PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions

  The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern
  matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has its own native
  API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular
  expression API. The PCRE library is free, even for building proprietary software.
