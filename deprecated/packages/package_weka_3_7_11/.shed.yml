  Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining
  tasks.

  The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from
  your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing,
  classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.
  It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.
