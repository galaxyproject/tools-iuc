long_description: |
  This installation recipe installs the Anaconda version 2.3.0 of the Python programming language
  version 2.7.10.  Anaconda is a completely free Python distribution (including for commercial use
  and redistribution). It includes more than 300 of the most popular Python packages for science,
  math, engineering, and data analysis.  Care should be taken in using the Anaconda Python environment
  that is installed by this recipe.  Other recipes should not be used to install additional Python
  packages into this environment as doing so will adversely impact reproducibility for tools that
  depend on this package.  Installation recipes that take advantage of the Anaconda Python environment
  (but that need additional packages) should be written as separate, self-contained recipes.
