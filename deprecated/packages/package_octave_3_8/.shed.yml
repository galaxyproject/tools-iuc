  GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended
  for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution
  of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments.
  It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.
  Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can
  also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar
  to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.
