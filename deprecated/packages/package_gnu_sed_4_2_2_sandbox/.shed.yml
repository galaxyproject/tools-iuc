  4.2.2 of the GNU sed + an addidtion sandbox feature.
long_description: |
  sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic
  text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While
  in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed
  works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.
  But it is sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes
  it from other types of editors.

  This contains an additional patch developed by Assaf Gordon that add a --sandbox
  feature to disables potentially harmful sed functions, when used in Galaxy.
