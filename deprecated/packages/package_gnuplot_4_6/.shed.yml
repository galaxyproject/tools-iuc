  Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for
  Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. It was originally created
  to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data interactively,
  but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is
  also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave.
