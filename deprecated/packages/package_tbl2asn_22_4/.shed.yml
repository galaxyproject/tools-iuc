  tbl2asn is an automated bulk submission program

  tbl2asn is a program that automates the submission of sequence records to
  GenBank.  It uses many of the same functions as Sequin, but is driven
  entirely by data files, and records need no additional manual editing before
  submission.  Entire genomes, consisting of many chromosomes with feature
  annotation, can be processed in seconds using this method.
