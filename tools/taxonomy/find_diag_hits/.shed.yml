description: Find diagnostic hits
long_description: |
  When performing metagenomic analyses it is often necessary to identify
  sequence reads corresponding to a particular taxonomic group, or, in other words,
  diagnostic of a particular taxonomic rank. This utility performs this analysis.
  It takes data generated by Taxonomy manipulation->Fetch Taxonomic Ranks as input
  and outputs either a list of sequence reads unique to a particular taxonomic rank,
  or a list of taxonomic ranks and the count of unique reads corresponding to each
  rank.
