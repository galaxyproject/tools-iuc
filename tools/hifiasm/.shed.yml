long_description: |
  Hifiasm is a fast haplotype-resolved de novo assembler
  for PacBio Hifi reads. It can assemble a human genome
  in several hours and works with the California redwood
  genome, one of the most complex genomes sequenced so
  far. Hifiasm can produce primary/alternate assemblies
  of quality competitive with the best assemblers. It
  also introduces a new graph binning algorithm and
  achieves the best haplotype-resolved assembly given
  trio data.
