  "The SECIMTools is suite includes a comprehensive set of quality control
        metrics (retention time window evaluation and various peak evaluation
        tools), visualization techniques (hierarchical cluster heatmap,
        principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, modular
        modularity clustering), basic statistical analysis methods (partial
        least squares - discriminant analysis, analysis of variance), advanced
        classification methods (random forest, support vector machines), and
        advanced variable selection tools (least absolute shrinkage and
        selection operator LASSO and Elastic Net)."
