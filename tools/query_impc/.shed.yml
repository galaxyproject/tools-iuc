  With this tool, it is possible to submit various types of queries to the IMPC database. Select the desired query from the drop down menu. 
  As input both MGI ids or gene symbols are allowed (even mixed). If you want to input more than one id, separate them with a comma without spaces (eg: MGI:104636,MGI:104637). 
  If a mixed input is retrieved, the order after the mapping will not be maintained. Note that if the mapping between the two types of ids doesn't retrieves a result, 
  that id will not be included in the query input, resulting in an error if all of the ids are not mapped. The output will be a table containing the data.
  For the phenotypes, is possible to give as input both MP term ids or HP terms ids since they will be mapped to MP terms (also here the order of the input will not be maintained).
  For both genes and phenotypes mapping, check the "View details" section of the job to check if some of them were not mapped (typo errors/id not present in the database).
