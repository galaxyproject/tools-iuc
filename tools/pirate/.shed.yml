description: Pangenome Iterative Refinement and Threshold Evaluation.
long_description: |
  PIRATE is a comprehensive pangenomics toolbox for gene clustering and pangenome 
  construction. It uses a range of identity thresholds to iteratively refine 
  gene clusters, allowing for the identification of orthologs across diverse 
  evolutionary scales and the classification of complex paralogous gene families.
