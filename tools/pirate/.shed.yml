description: Analysing the pangenomes of bacteria, from largely clonal to panmictic species with Pirate.
long_description: |
   The pangenomics toolbox PIRATE identifies and classifies orthologous gene families in bacterial pangenomes over a wide range of sequence similarity thresholds. It builds upon recent scalable  software developments for the rapid interrogation of pangenomes. PIRATE clusters genes over a wide range of amino-acid or nucleotide identity thresholds, and classifies paralogous genes families into either putative gene fission/fusion events or gene duplications. Furthermore, PIRATE provides a measure of allelic variance and cluster homology, and orders the resulting pangenome on a pangenome graph.
