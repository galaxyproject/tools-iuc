  SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) is a generic format for storing large
  nucleotide sequence alignments. Picard comprises Java-based utilities that manipulate
  SAM files, and a Java API (SAM-JDK) for creating new programs that read and write
  SAM files. Both SAM text format and SAM binary (BAM) format are supported.
