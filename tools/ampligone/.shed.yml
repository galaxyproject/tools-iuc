    AmpliGone is a tool which accurately finds and removes primer sequences from NGS reads 
    in an amplicon experiment. 
long_description: |
    AmpliGone is build and tested with Nanopore and Illumina data (fastq) in mind and supports 
    'end-to-end', 'end-to-mid' and 'fragmented' amplicons to be cleaned. In contrast to a lot 
    of other primer-removal tools, AmpliGone does not actively look for primer sequences within 
    the NGS reads. Instead, reads are trimmed based on primer sequence coordinates in relation 
    to a given reference sequence. Additionally, AmpliGone is able to compensate for, and 
    therefore properly clean, reads that start or end outside of a primer-region as this is a 
    common occurrence in amplicon-based sequencing data.
