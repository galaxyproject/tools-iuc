description: Detect low-complexity regions in long DNA sequences using k-mer statistics.
long_description: |
   longdust is a sequence analysis tool for detecting low-complexity ("dusty") regions in long DNA sequences. 
   These regions often correspond to homopolymers, simple repeats, or other low-information content stretches 
   that can negatively affect downstream analyses such as read mapping, genome assembly, or variant calling.
