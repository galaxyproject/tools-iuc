  BiG-SCAPE (Biosynthetic Gene Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine)
  is a software package, written in Python, that constructs sequence similarity
  networks of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) and groups them into Gene Cluster
  Families (GCFs). BiG-SCAPE does this by rapidly calculating a distance matrix
  between gene clusters based on a comparison of their protein domain content,
  order, copy number and sequence identity.
