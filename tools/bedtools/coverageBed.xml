**What it does**

`bedtools coverage`_ computes both the *depth* and *breadth* of coverage of features in 
file B on the features in file A. For example, ``bedtools coverage`` can compute the coverage of sequence alignments 
(file B) across 1 kilobase (arbitrary) windows (file A) tiling a genome of interest. 
One advantage that ``bedtools coverage`` offers is that it not only *counts* the number of features that 
overlap an interval in file A, it also computes the fraction of bases in the interval in A that were overlapped by one or more features.
Thus, ``bedtools coverage`` also computes the *breadth* of coverage for each interval in A.

.. _bedtools coverage: http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/coverage.html

.. class:: infomark

The lines in the output will be comprised of each interval in A, followed by:

1. The number of features in B that overlapped (by at least one base pair) the A interval.
2. The number of bases in A that had non-zero coverage from features in B.
3. The length of the entry in A.
4. The fraction of bases in A that had non-zero coverage from features in B.
