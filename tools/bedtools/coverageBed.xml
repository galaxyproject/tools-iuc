**What it does**

coverageBed_ computes both the depth and breadth of coverage of features in 
file A across the features in file B. For example, coverageBed can compute the coverage of sequence alignments 
(file A) across 1 kilobase (arbitrary) windows (file B) tiling a genome of interest. 
One advantage that coverageBed offers is that it not only counts the number of features that 
overlap an interval in file B, it also computes the fraction of bases in B interval that were overlapped by one or more features.
Thus, coverageBed also computes the breadth of coverage for each interval in B.

.. _coverageBed: http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/coverage.html

.. class:: infomark

The output file will be comprised of each interval from your original target BED file, plus an additional column indicating the number of intervals in your source file that overlapped that target interval.
