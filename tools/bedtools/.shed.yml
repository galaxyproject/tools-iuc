description: bedtools is a powerful toolset for genome arithmetic
long_description: |
  Collectively, the bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of
  tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. The most widely-used tools enable
  genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. For example, bedtools allows
  one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple
  files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF. While
  each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect
  two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted by combining
  multiple bedtools operations.
