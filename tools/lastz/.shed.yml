  LASTZ is designed to preprocess one sequence or set of sequences 
  (which we collectively call the TARGET) and then align several 
  QUERY sequences to it. LASTZ_D is a non-integer (D stands for Double) 
  version of LASTZ that can be used to estimate substitution matrix 
  that will be used to score alignments.
