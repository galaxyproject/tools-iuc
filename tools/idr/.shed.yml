    idr is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq
    data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput sequencing
    reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly
    determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for
    alignment.
