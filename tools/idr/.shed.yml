    The IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate) framework is a unified approach to measure
    the reproducibility of findings identified from replicate experiments and provide
    highly stable thresholds based on reproducibility. Unlike the usual scalar measures
    of reproducibility, the IDR approach creates a curve, which quantitatively assesses
    when the findings are no longer consistent across replicates.
