  description: HMMER v3 HMM based sequence alignment and database search tools
long_description: |
  HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs of protein
  sequences, and for making protein sequence alignments. It implements
  methods using probabilistic models called profile hidden Markov models
  (profile HMMs).
