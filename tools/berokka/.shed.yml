        There is already a good piece of software to trim/circularise and orient genome assemblies called Circlator. Please try that first! 
        You should only try Berokka if... 
        1) You only have the contig files and do not have the corrected reads anymore.
        2) Your contigs are simple cases with clear overhang and could be done manually with BLAST.
        3) Circlator fails on your data even after troubleshooting.
        Berocca is a brand of effervescent drink and vitamin tablets containing vitamin B and C. It is a popular cure for a hangover. A key role of the berokka tool is to remove the "overhang" that occurs at the ends of long-read assemblies of circular genomes.
