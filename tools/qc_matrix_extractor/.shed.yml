description: Extracts and summarizes QC metrics from MultiQC tabular output to produce a clean, threshold-based QC matrix.
long_description: |
  The QC Matrix Extractor parses MultiQC tabular output and generates a QC matrix summarizing key sequencing quality metrics 
  such as total reads, mapping percentage, coverage, GC content, and contamination. It flags samples as Pass/Fail based on 
  user-defined thresholds. 
  Users can customize thresholds and select columns of interest or leave them empty to 
  include all available metrics.
