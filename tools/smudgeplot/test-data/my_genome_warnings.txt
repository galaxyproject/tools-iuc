!! Warning, your coverage filter on the lower end (L = 	23	) is higher than half of the 1n coverage estimate ( 1n / 2 = 	12.5
If the real 1n coverage is half of your estimate you would not picked it up due to the filtering.
If you have sufficient coverage, consider reruning the analysis with lower L (something like (1n / 2) - 5)
One good way for verificaiton would be to compare it to GenomeScope estimate of haploid coverage
