long_description: |
  This tool extracts heterozygous kmer pairs from kmer count databases and performs gymnastics with them. We are able to disentangle genome structure by comparing the sum of kmer pair coverages (CovA + CovB) to their relative coverage (CovB / (CovA + CovB)). Such an approach also allows us to analyze obscure genomes with duplications, various ploidy levels, etc. Smudgeplots are computed from raw or even better from trimmed reads and show the haplotype structure using heterozygous kmer pairs.
