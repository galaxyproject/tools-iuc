  LEMUR is an R package that identifies transcriptional differences across conditions 
  in latent space using single-cell RNA-seq data. It enables users to train 
  interpretable latent variable models and perform differential expression analysis
  across conditions, patients, or neighborhoods in the latent space.

  long_description: |
    LEMUR is a framework for analyzing multi-condition single-cell RNA-seq data. 
    It predicts, for each cell and gene, the expected expression across all conditions 
    in the dataset. In addition to this predictive modeling, LEMUR identifies neighborhoods 
    of cells that exhibit consistent differential expression patterns.

    The method combines matrix factorization and regression via geodesic regression 
    on Grassmann manifoldsâ€”referred to as latent embedding multivariate regression. 
    It disentangles the effects of known covariates, latent states, and their interactions, 
    and validates differential expression using pseudo-bulk testing on held-out data 
    via glmGamPoi or edgeR.

    LEMUR simplifies the interpretation of complex, multi-condition single-cell datasets 
    through a unified latent space representation and robust statistical testing.
