  antiSMASH allows the rapid genome-wide identification, annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters in bacterial and fungal genomes.
  It integrates and cross-links with a large number of in silico secondary metabolite analysis tools that have been published earlier.
  antiSMASH is powered by several open source tools - NCBI BLAST+, HMMer 3, Muscle 3, Glimmer 3, FastTree, TreeGraph 2, Indigo-depict, PySVG and JQuery SVG.
