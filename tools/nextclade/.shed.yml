description: Identify differences between your sequences and a reference sequence used by Nextstrain
long_description: |
  Nextclade is a tool that identifies differences between your sequences
  and a reference sequence used by Nextstrain, uses these differences to
  assign your sequences to clades, and reports potential sequence quality
  issues in your data. You can use the tool to analyze sequences before
  you upload them to a database, or if you want to assign Nextstrain
  clades to a set of sequences.
