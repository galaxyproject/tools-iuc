description: dos2unix convert text files with DOS or Mac line breaks to Unix line breaks and vice versa.
long_description: |
   The dos2unix tool is a command-line tool used to convert plain text files from the DOS/Microsoft 
   Windows format (which uses carriage return and line feed CRLF line endings) to the Unix/Linux format 
   (which uses only line feed LF line endings). This conversion is essential when transferring text files 
   between different operating systems to ensure compatibility with Unix-based tools and scripts that may 
   misinterpret DOS-style endings. In addition to basic line ending conversion, dos2unix can handle 
   different encodings (including UTF-8 and BOMs).
