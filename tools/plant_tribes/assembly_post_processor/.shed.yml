  Contains a tool that is one of the PlantTribes collection of automated modular analysis pipelines that
  utilize objective classifications of complete protein sequences from sequenced plant genomes to perform
  comparative evolutionary studies. It postprocesses de novo assembly transcripts into putative coding
  sequences and their corresponding amino acid translations, locally assembling targeted gene families.
