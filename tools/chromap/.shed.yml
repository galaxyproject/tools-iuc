description: Fast alignment and preprocessing of chromatin profiles.
long_description: |
  Chromap is a fast aligner and preprocessing tool for chromatin profiling data,
  including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, and single-cell assays.
  It builds a chromap index from a reference FASTA and then
  maps single-end or paired-end reads using that index within a single tool
  execution. Optional barcode handling, preset configurations, and multiple
  output formats (SAM, BED/BEDPE, TagAlign, 4DN pairs) are supported.
