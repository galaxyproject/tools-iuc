  Pathview is a tool set for pathway based data integration and visualization. All users need 
  is to supply their data and specify the target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the 
  pathway graph data, parses the data file, maps user data to the pathway, and render pathway 
  graph with the mapped data. In addition, Pathview also seamlessly integrates with pathway and 
  gene set (enrichment) analysis tools for large-scale and fully automated analysis.
