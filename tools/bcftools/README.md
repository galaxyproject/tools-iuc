# bcftools (v1.2)

This aims to be a "faithful" rendering of the bcftool suite. I.e. options are
presented essentially as closely to the command line version as is useful. 

This may not appeal to all, if you'd like to see smaller and more dedicated
tools (e.g. "intersect", "union" and "complement" being separate tools instead
of all of them included in the "isec" tool,) please feel free to file an issue.

## TODO:

- Galaxy needs datatypes for bcf and vcf files, block-gzipped and uncompressed.
- Galaxy needs to automatically index those files with tabix

## "Complete" Wrappers

The wrappers were automatically generated in bulk. That doesn't get them 100%
of the way there (e.g. meaningful test cases), so the rest of the process is a
bit slower.
