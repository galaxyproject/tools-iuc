    <help><![CDATA[
        Reads a delta alignment file from either nucmer or promer and filters the alignments based on the command-line switches, leaving only the desired alignments which are output to stdout in the same delta format as the input. For multiple switches, order of operations is as follows: -i -l -u -q -r -g -m -1. If an alignment is excluded by a preceding operation, it will be ignored by the succeeding operations.
        An important distinction between the -g option and the -1 and -m options is that -g requires the alignments to be mutually consistent in their order, while the -1 and -m options are not required to be mutually consistent and therefore tolerate translocations, inversions, etc. In general cases, the -m option is the best choice, however -1 can be handy for applications such as SNP finding which require a 1-to-1 mapping. Finally, for mapping query contigs, or sequencing reads, to a reference genome, use -q.
