long_description: |
  NGS-Q/C Generator infers global and local quality indicators based on a stand-alone approach; e.i avoiding the necessity of further wet-lab efforts. This computational approach evaluates the distribution of the sequencing reads associated to a particular NGS profile and this for distinct sampled populations.

  Specifically, the total and uniquely aligned mapped reads (TMRs) are randomly sampled at three different densities; namely 90%, 70% and 50% (described here as s90, s70 and s50 respectively).
  Then, the genome-wide distribution of the sampled reads population is evaluated in the context of 500bp bins covering the genome of interest.
