    Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and transcript lengths,
    and summarizes into matrices for use with downstream statistical analysis
    packages such as edgeR, DESeq2, limma-voom. Average transcript length,
    weighted by sample-specific transcript abundance estimates, is provided as a
    matrix which can be used as an offset for different expression of gene-level
    counts.
