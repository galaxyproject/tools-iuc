long_description: |
    Teloscope reads an assembly and decomposes its parts. It uses prefix
    trees and sliding windows to match and count telomeric repeats
    efficiently. It also analyzes the informational properties of the
    assembly to distinguish canonical and non-canonical telomere repeats.
