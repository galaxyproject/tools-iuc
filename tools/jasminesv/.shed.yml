long_description: Jointly Accurate Sv Merging with Intersample Network Edges is a tool used to merge structural variants (SVs) across samples. Each sample has a number of SV calls, consisting of position information (chromosome, start, end, length), type and strand information, and a number of other values. Jasmine represents the set of all SVs across samples as a network, and uses a modified minimum spanning forest algorithm to determine the best way of merging the variants such that each merged variants represents a set of analogous variants occurring in different samples.
