description: "HiCExplorer: Set of programs to process, analyze and visualize Hi-C data."
long_description: |
  Sequencing techniques that probe the 3D organization of the genome generate large amounts of
  data whose processing, analysis and visualization is challenging. Here, we present Hi-C Explorer,
  a set of tools for the analysis and visualization of chromosome conformation data. Hi-C explorer
  facilitates the creation of contact matrices, correction of contacts, TAD detection, merging,
  reordering or chromosomes, conversion from different formats and detection of long-range contacts.
  Moreover, it allows the visualization of multiple contact matrices along with other types of data
  like genes, compartments, ChIP-seq coverage tracks (and in general any type of genomic scores) and long range contacts.
