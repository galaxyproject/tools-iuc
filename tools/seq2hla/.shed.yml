description: Precision HLA typing and expression from RNAseq data
long_description: |
  seq2HLA is an in-silico method, written in python and R, 
  which takes standard RNA-Seq sequence reads in fastq format as input, 
  uses a bowtie index comprising all HLA alleles and outputs 
  the most likely HLA class I and class II genotypes (in 4 digit resolution),
  a p-value for each call, and the expression of each class
