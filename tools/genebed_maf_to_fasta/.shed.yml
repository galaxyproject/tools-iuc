long_description: |
  This tool takes a list of coding exons (in the Gene BED format) and a MAF
  alignment file, finds all MAF blocks that overlap the coding regions, sorts
  MAF blocks by alignment score, stitches blocks together resolving overlaps
  based on alignment score, and finally outputs the stitched alignments in FASTA
  format.
