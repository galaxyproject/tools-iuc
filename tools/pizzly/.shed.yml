    Pizzly is a program for detecting gene fusions from RNA-Seq data of cancer samples.
    It uses pseudoalignment and requires running Kallisto with the --fusion parameter (available in version 0.43.1 or later) on paired-end reads.
    Pizzly also requires the reference transcriptome in FASTA format as well as a GTF file describing the transcriptome. 
    The Ensembl transcriptomes are recommended.
