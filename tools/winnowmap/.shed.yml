  Winnowmap is a novel weighted-minimizer sampling algorithm. 
  A unique feature is that it performs minimizer sampling while 
  considering a weight for each k-mer; i.e. the higher the 
  weight of a k-mer, the more likely it is to be selected. 
  By down-weighting frequently occurring k-mers, we are able 
  to meet both objectives: (i) avoid excessive false-positive 
  matches and (ii) maintain the minimizer match guarantee.
