long_description: 'rpbasicdesign extracts enzyme IDs from rpSBML files -- produced by the
  RP suite available in SynBioCAD Galaxy platform -- to generate genetic constructs
  compliant with the BASIC assembly approach. CSV files produced are ready to be used
  with DNA-Bot to generate instructions for automated build of the genetic constructs
  using OpenTrons liquid handling robots.'
