long_description: |
    Contig2fastg is a subprogram within the MEGAHIT toolkit. It converts MEGAHIT's contigs (.fa) to assembly graphs (.fastg) that can be utilized for protein/peptide identification via graph2pro and can also be visualized via Bandage. MEGAHIT is a single node assembler for large and complex metagenomics NGS reads, such as soil. It makes use of succinct de Bruijn graph (SdBG) to achieve low memory assembly.
