homepage_url: https://github.com/SantaMcCloud/fastq-groupmerge
long_description: |
  This tool takes multiple fastq read files as input and merges them based on 
  the provided metadata file (multiple groups allowed).
  It is designed to support workflows that require specific sample grouping 
  - such as co- and group-assembly - or any other use cases where merging reads is necessary.
