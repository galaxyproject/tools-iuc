description:  Classifying metagenomes by jointly analysing both DNA and amino
    acid (AA) sequences
long_description: |
    Metabuli is metagenomic classifier that jointly analyse both DNA and amino
    acid (AA) sequences. DNA-based classifiers can make specific
    classifications, exploiting point mutations to distinguish close taxa.
    AA-based classifiers have higher sensitivity in detecting homology between
    query and reference sequences, leverageing higher conservation of AA
    sequences. Metabuli combines the information of both sequence types using a
    novel k-mer structure, metamer, to enable both specific and sensitive
    characterization of metagenomic samples. In addition, it can classify reads
    against a database of any size as long as it fits in the hard disk.
