  FEELnc (FlExible Extraction of LncRNAs) pipeline is used in order to annotate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) based on reconstructed transcripts from RNA-seq data (either with or without a reference genome). It is an alignment-free program that accurately annotates lncRNAs based on a Random Forest model trained with general features such as multi k-mer frequencies and relaxed open reading frames.
