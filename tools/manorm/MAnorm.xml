The window size should match the typical length of peaks, thus we recommend extension=1000 for sharp histone marks like H3K4me2/3 or H3K9/27ac, extension=500 for transcription factor or DNase-seq." />
    <param name="d"  type="integer" optional="true" value="500" label="summit to summit distance cutoff, default=extension/2. Only those common peaks with distance between their summits in 2 samples smaller than this value will be considered as real common peaks for building the normalization model." />

Sample 1 biased peaks are defined as sample 1 unique peaks with M-value > mcut_biased and P-value < pcut_biased, while sample 2 biased peaks are defined as sample 2 unique peaks with M-value < -1*mcut_biased and P-value < pcut_biased." />
