description: Accepts two heatmaps (.png) files, usually generated from sense and anti-sense datasets, to generate a single blended or merged image (.png). The tool overlays the two images and calculates the average (rgb) color values necessary at each pixel overlap between the images. This allows to visualize a dynamic blended gradient where the two datasets overlap.
