description: Build Sensing-Enabling Metabolic Pathways from RetroPath2.0 output
homepage_url: https://github.com/brsynth/rp2biosensor
long_description: 'rp2biosensor extracts metabolic paths linking undetectable compounds
  into a detectable one using biochemical reactions. This concept is known as "Sensing-Enabling
  Metabolic Pathways". In short, rp2bionsensor converts the output of RetroPath2.0
  into a HTML page showing the possible metabolic paths linking the compound to be
  detected to the detectable ones.'
