description: Identification of SARS-CoV-2 related mutations based on a single (or a list) of variant(s) file(s)

long_description: |
  Lineagespot is a framework written in R, and aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 related mutations based on a single 
  (or a list) of variant(s) file(s) (i.e., variant calling format). The method can facilitate the detection of 
  SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples using next generation sequencing, and attempts to infer the potential 
  distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages.
