long_description: |
  Lineagespot is a framework written in R, and aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 related mutations based on a single
  (or a list of) variant(s) file(s) (i.e., variant calling format). The method can facilitate the detection of
  SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples using next generation sequencing, and attempts to infer the potential
  distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages.
