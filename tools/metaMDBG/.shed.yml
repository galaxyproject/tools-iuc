long_description: |
  MetaMDBG is a fast and low-memory assembler for long and accurate metagenomics reads (e.g. PacBio HiFi, Nanopore r10.4). It is based on the minimizer de-Brujin graph (MDBG), which have been reimplemetend specifically for metagenomics assembly. MetaMDBG combines an efficient multi-k approach in minimizer-space for dealing with uneven species coverages, and a novel abundance-based filtering method for simplifying strain complexity.
  The method nanoMDBG for assembling simplex Nanopore reads (R10.4+) is integrated in metaMDBG.
