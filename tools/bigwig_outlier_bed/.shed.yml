  Bigwigs are great. Peaks are easy to see. Small runs of very low values not so much

  Using numpy to segment bigwig values into regions of contiguous high and low values, this tool writes bed files
  containing those regions, with a score set to 1 or -1 depending on whether above the top quantile or below the
  low quantile.

  Quantile values recommended are 0.01 and 0.99. They are calculated for each chromosome and vary a bit.
  Ideally should be estimated over the entire assembly but not feasible without sampling due to RAM hoggery.
  Minimum window size of 10 will give a very, very low risk of random false positives at about 0.01**10 for 0.01
  quantile cutoff for example.
