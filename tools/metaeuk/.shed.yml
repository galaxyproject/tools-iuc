  MetaEuk is a modular toolkit designed for large-scale gene discovery and
  annotation in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. Metaeuk combines the fast and
  sensitive homology search capabilities of MMseqs2 with a dynamic programming
  procedure to recover optimal exons sets. It reduces redundancies in multiple
  discoveries of the same gene and resolves conflicting gene predictions on
  the same strand.
