description: Detect circular sequences (e.g. circular contigs) in a FASTA file
long_description: |
  Detect circular contigs by looking for exact identical subsequences at the two
  ends of the sequences provided in a FASTA file and output the circular contigs 
  extended on 5' end by duplication of the first nucleotides on 3' end to be able 
  to predict genes spanning the origin of circular contigs.

  Inspired by Simon Roux work for Metavir2 (2014) and Corentin Hochart work in PlasSuite
