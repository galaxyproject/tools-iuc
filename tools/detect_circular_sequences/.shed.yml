description: Detect circular sequences (e.g. circular contigs) in a FASTA file by k-mer matching
long_description: |
  Detect circular sequences (e.g. circular contigs) by looking for exact identical k-mer at the two
  ends on a cadre sequence of the sequences prodvide in fasta file. In order to be able
  to predict genes spanning the origin of circular sequences, the first 1,000 nucleotides
  of each circular sequences are duplicated and added at the sequence's end.
