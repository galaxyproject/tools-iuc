    MaAsLin 3 is the next generation of MaAsLin (Microbiome Multivariable Associations with Linear Models). 
    This comprehensive R package efficiently determines multivariable associations between clinical metadata 
    and microbial meta-omics features. Relative to MaAsLin 2, MaAsLin 3 introduces the ability to quantify 
    and test for both abundance and prevalence associations while accounting for compositionality.
    By incorporating generalized linear models, MaAsLin 3 accomodates most modern epidemiological study 
    designs including cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.
