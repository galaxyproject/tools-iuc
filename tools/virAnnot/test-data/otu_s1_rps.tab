Bacitracin resistance protein (BacA) is a putative undecaprenol kinase. BacA confers resistance to bacitracin, probably by phosphorylation of undecaprenol. More recent studies show that BacA has undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity. Undecaprenyl phosphate is a key lipid intermediate involved in the synthesis of various bacterial cell wall polymers. Bacitracin, a mixture of related cyclic polypeptide antibiotics, is used to treat surface tissue infections. Its primary mode of action is the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis through sequestration of the essential carrier lipid undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, C55-PP, resulting in the loss of cell integrity and lysis. The characteristic phosphatase sequence-motif in this family is likely to be the PGxSRSGG, compared with the PSGH of the PAP family of phosphatases."

Methionine sulfoxide reduction is an important process, by which cells regulate biological processes and cope with oxidative stress. MsrA, a protein involved in the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in proteins, has been known for four decades and has been extensively characterized with respect to structure and function. However, recent studies revealed that MsrA is only specific for methionine-S-sulfoxides. Because oxidized methionines occur in a mixture of R and S isomers in vivo, it was unclear how stereo-specific MsrA could be responsible for the reduction of all protein methionine sulfoxides. It appears that a second methionine sulfoxide reductase, SelR, evolved that is specific for methionine-R-sulfoxides, the activity that is different but complementary to that of MsrA. Thus, these proteins, working together, could reduce both stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide. This domain is found both in SelR proteins and fused with the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymatic domain pfam01625. The domain has two conserved cysteine and histidines.
