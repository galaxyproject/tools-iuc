Methionine sulfoxide reduction is an important process, by which cells regulate biological processes and cope with oxidative stress. MsrA, a protein involved in the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in proteins, has been known for four decades and has been extensively characterized with respect to structure and function. However, recent studies revealed that MsrA is only specific for methionine-S-sulfoxides. Because oxidized methionines occur in a mixture of R and S isomers in vivo, it was unclear how stereo-specific MsrA could be responsible for the reduction of all protein methionine sulfoxides. It appears that a second methionine sulfoxide reductase, SelR, evolved that is specific for methionine-R-sulfoxides, the activity that is different but complementary to that of MsrA. Thus, these proteins, working together, could reduce both stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide. This domain is found both in SelR proteins and fused with the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymatic domain pfam01625. The domain has two conserved cysteine and histidines. The domain binds both selenium and zinc. The final cysteine is found to be replaced by the rare amino acid selenocysteine in some members of the family. This family has methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase activity.	Eukaryota(2597);Bacteria(6243);Archaea(117);

Atrophin-1 is the protein product of the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) gene. DRPLA OMIM:125370 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the DRPLA gene on chromosome 12p. This results in an extended polyglutamine region in atrophin-1, that is thought to confer toxicity to the protein, possibly through altering its interactions with other proteins. The expansion of a CAG repeat is also the underlying defect in six other neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. One interaction of expanded polyglutamine repeats that is thought to be pathogenic is that with the short glutamine repeat in the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein, CBP. This interaction draws CBP away from its usual nuclear location to the expanded polyglutamine repeat protein aggregates that are characteristic of the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders. This interferes with CBP-mediated transcription and causes cytotoxicity.	Eukaryota(1138);

Members of this family include regulator of ribonuclease E activity A (RraA) and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate (HMG)/4-carboxy- 4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (CHA) aldolase, also known as RraA-like protein. RraA acts as a trans-acting modulator of RNA turnover, binding essential endonuclease RNase E and inhibiting RNA processing.

Group II introns use intron-encoded reverse transcriptase, maturase and DNA endonuclease activities for site-specific insertion into DNA. Although this type of intron is self splicing in vitro they require a maturase protein for splicing in vivo.

Protein degradation is an essential component of regulation because proteins can become misfolded, damaged, or unnecessary. Proteasomes and their homologs vary greatly in complexity: from HslV (heat shock locus v), which is encoded by 1 gene in bacteria, to the eukaryotic 20S proteasome, which is encoded by more than 14 genes. Recently evidence of two novel groups of bacterial proteasomes was proposed. The first is Anbu, which is sparsely distributed among cyanobacteria and proteobacteria. The second is call beta-proteobacteria proteasome homolog (BPH).	Eukaryota(21534);Bacteria(5126);Archaea(484);

Vps36 is involved in Golgi to endosome trafficking. EAP30 is a subunit of the ELL complex. The ELL is an 80-kDa RNA polymerase II transcription factor. ELL interacts with three other proteins to form the complex known as ELL complex. The ELL complex is capable of increasing that catalytic rate of transcription elongation, but is unable to repress initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II as is the case of ELL.

This is a family of membrane transporters that inlcudes some 7 of potentially 14-16 TM regions. In many instances the family forms part of complex I that catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone in a reaction that is associated with proton translocation across the membrane, and in this context is a combination predominantly of subunits 2, 4, 5, 14, L, M and N.

BacA confers resistance to bacitracin, probably by phosphorylation of undecaprenol. More recent studies show that BacA has undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity. Undecaprenyl phosphate is a key lipid intermediate involved in the synthesis of various bacterial cell wall polymers. Bacitracin, a mixture of related cyclic polypeptide antibiotics, is used to treat surface tissue infections. Its primary mode of action is the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis through sequestration of the essential carrier lipid undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, C55-PP, resulting in the loss of cell integrity and lysis. The characteristic phosphatase sequence-motif in this family is likely to be the PGxSRSGG, compared with the PSGH of the PAP family of phosphatases.	Bacteria(5946);Archaea(63);

They usually consist of three main regions - a C-terminal transmembrane region, a central SNARE domain which is characteristic of and conserved in all syntaxins (pfam05739), and an N-terminal domain that is featured in this entry. This domain varies between syntaxin isoforms; in syntaxin 1A it is found as three alpha-helices with a left-handed twist. It may fold back on the SNARE domain to allow the molecule to adopt a 'closed' configuration that prevents formation of the core fusion complex - it thus has an auto-inhibitory role. The function of syntaxins is determined by their localization. They are involved in neuronal exocytosis, ER-Golgi transport and Golgi-endosome transport, for example. They also interact with other proteins as well as those involved in SNARE complexes. These include vesicle coat proteins, Rab GTPases, and tethering factors.	Eukaryota(6611);

This family consists of various proteins involved in cytochrome c assembly from mitochondria and bacteria; CycK from Rhizobium, CcmC from E. coli and Paracoccus denitrificans and orf240 from wheat mitochondria. The members of this family are probably integral membrane proteins with six predicted transmembrane helices. It has been proposed that members of this family comprise a membrane component of an ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter complex. It is also proposed that this transporter is necessary for transport of some component needed for cytochrome c assembly. One member CycK contains a putative heme-binding motif, orf240 also contains a putative heme-binding motif and is a proposed ABC transporter with c-type heme as its proposed substrate. However it seems unlikely that all members of this family transport heme nor c-type apocytochromes because CcmC in the putative CcmABC transporter transports neither. CcmF forms a working module with CcmH and CcmI, CcmFHI, and itself is unlikely to bind haem directly.	Eukaryota(382);Bacteria(8596);Archaea(46);
