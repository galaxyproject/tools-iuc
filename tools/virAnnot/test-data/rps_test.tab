ds2020-267_773	210	pfam01641	gnl|CDD|376583	5.23903e-34	16	174	1	pfam01641, SelR, SelR domain.  Methionine sulfoxide reduction is an important process, by which cells regulate biological processes and cope with oxidative stress. MsrA, a protein involved in the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in proteins, has been known for four decades and has been extensively characterized with respect to structure and function. However, recent studies revealed that MsrA is only specific for methionine-S-sulfoxides. Because oxidized methionines occur in a mixture of R and S isomers in vivo, it was unclear how stereo-specific MsrA could be responsible for the reduction of all protein methionine sulfoxides. It appears that a second methionine sulfoxide reductase, SelR, evolved that is specific for methionine-R-sulfoxides, the activity that is different but complementary to that of MsrA. Thus, these proteins, working together, could reduce both stereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide. This domain is found both in SelR proteins and fused with the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymatic domain pfam01625. The domain has two conserved cysteine and histidines. The domain binds both selenium and zinc. The final cysteine is found to be replaced by the rare amino acid selenocysteine in some members of the family. This family has methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase activity.	Bacteria(2);cellular organisms(1);Pseudomonadota(1)

Atrophin-1 is the protein product of the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) gene. DRPLA OMIM:125370 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the DRPLA gene on chromosome 12p. This results in an extended polyglutamine region in atrophin-1, that is thought to confer toxicity to the protein, possibly through altering its interactions with other proteins. The expansion of a CAG repeat is also the underlying defect in six other neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. One interaction of expanded polyglutamine repeats that is thought to be pathogenic is that with the short glutamine repeat in the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein, CBP. This interaction draws CBP away from its usual nuclear location to the expanded polyglutamine repeat protein aggregates that are characteristic of the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders. This interferes with CBP-mediated transcription and causes cytotoxicity.	Eukaryota(1);cellular organisms(1);Opisthokonta(1);Metazoa(1)

A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.

Members of this family include regulator of ribonuclease E activity A (RraA) and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-oxoglutarate (HMG)/4-carboxy- 4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (CHA) aldolase, also known as RraA-like protein. RraA acts as a trans-acting modulator of RNA turnover, binding essential endonuclease RNase E and inhibiting RNA processing. RraA-like proteins seem to contain aldolase and/or decarboxylase activity either in place of or in addition to the RNase E inhibitor functions.	Bacteria(2);cellular organisms(1);Pseudomonadota(1)

Group II introns use intron-encoded reverse transcriptase, maturase and DNA endonuclease activities for site-specific insertion into DNA. Although this type of intron is self splicing in vitro they require a maturase protein for splicing in vivo. It has been shown that a specific region of the aI2 intron is needed for the maturase function. This region was found to be conserved in group II introns and called domain X.	cellular organisms(1);Eukaryota(1);Viridiplantae(1);Streptophyta(1)
