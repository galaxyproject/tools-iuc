long_description: |
    RSeQC package provides a number of useful modules that can comprehensively
    evaluate high throughput sequence data especially RNA-seq data. Some basic
    modules quickly inspect sequence quality, nucleotide composition bias, PCR
    bias and GC bias, while RNA-seq specific modules evaluate sequencing
    saturation, mapped reads distribution, coverage uniformity, strand
    specificity, transcript level RNA integrity etc.
