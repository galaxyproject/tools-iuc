++++++++++++++++++++

Provided a BAM/SAM file and reference gene model, this module will calculate how mapped
reads were distributed over genome feature (like CDS exon, 5'UTR exon, 3' UTR exon, Intron,
Intergenic regions). When genome features are overlapped (e.g. a region could be annotated
as both exon and intron by two different transcripts) , they are prioritize as:
CDS exons > UTR exons > Introns > Intergenic regions, for example, if a read was mapped to
both CDS exon and intron, it will be assigned to CDS exons.

* "Total Reads": This does NOT include those QC fail,duplicate and non-primary hit reads
* "Total Tags": reads spliced once will be counted as 2 tags, reads spliced twice will be counted as 3 tags, etc. And because of this, "Total Tags" >= "Total Reads"
* "Total Assigned Tags": number of tags that can be unambiguously assigned the 10 groups (see below table).
* Tags assigned to "TSS_up_1kb" were also assigned to "TSS_up_5kb" and "TSS_up_10kb", tags assigned to "TSS_up_5kb" were also assigned to "TSS_up_10kb". Therefore, "Total Assigned Tags" = CDS_Exons + 5'UTR_Exons + 3'UTR_Exons + Introns + TSS_up_10kb + TES_down_10kb.
* When assign tags to genome features, each tag is represented by its middle point.

RSeQC cannot assign those reads that:

* hit to intergenic regions that beyond region starting from TSS upstream 10Kb to TES downstream 10Kb.
* hit to regions covered by both 5'UTR and 3' UTR. This is possible when two head-to-tail transcripts are overlapped in UTR regions.
* hit to regions covered by both TSS upstream 10Kb and TES downstream 10Kb.
