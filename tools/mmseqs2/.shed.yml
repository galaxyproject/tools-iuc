long_description:
  MMseqs2 is a fast and scalable software suite for searching, clustering, 
  and annotating large protein and nucleotide sequence datasets. It achieves 
  up to 10,000Ã— the speed of BLAST while maintaining high sensitivity, 
  supporting pairwise and profile-based searches, redundancy reduction, 
  taxonomic classification, and metagenomic analysis.
