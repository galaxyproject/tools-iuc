description: Performs analysis Of differential abundance taking sample variation into account
long_description: |
  Performs differential abundance analysis on data from standard RNA-seq or meta-RNA-seq
  assays as well as selected and unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections.
  ALDEx2 uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts, optimized
  for three or more experimental replicates.
