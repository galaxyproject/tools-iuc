  bctools is a set of tools for handling barcodes and UMIs in NGS data.

  bctools can be used to merge PCR duplicates according to unique molecular barcodes (UMIs),
  to extract barcodes from arbitrary positions relative to the read starts,
  to clean up readthroughs into UMIs with paired-end sequencing and
  handles binary barcodes as used with uvCLAP and FLASH.
