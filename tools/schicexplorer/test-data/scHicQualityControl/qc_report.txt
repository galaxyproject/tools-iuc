# QC report for single-cell Hi-C data generated by scHiCExplorer 4
scHi-C sample contained 20 cells:
Number of removed matrices containing bad chromosomes 0
Number of removed matrices due to low read coverage (< 100000): 10
Number of removed matrices due to too many zero bins (< 0.001 density, within 30000000 relative genomic distance): 0
10 samples passed the quality control. Please consider matrices with a low read coverage may be the matrices with a low density and overlap therefore.
