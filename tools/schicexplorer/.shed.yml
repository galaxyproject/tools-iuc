description: "scHiCExplorer: Set of programs to process, analyze and visualize scHi-C data."
long_description: |
  Sequencing techniques that probe the 3D organization of the genome generate large amounts of
  data whose processing, analysis and visualization is challenging. Here, we present scHiCExplorer,
  a set of tools for the analysis and visualization of single-cell chromosome conformation data. scHiCExplorer
  facilitates the creation of contact matrices, correction of contacts, merging,
  reordering or chromosomes, dimension reduction and clustering of cells.
