long description: |
   This tool is intended for use on the tabular (format 6) output generated by blastn. Depending on filtering choices, blast will output \
   all the alignments it generates. Often there are multiple overlapping alignments for a unique query sequence-accession number pair. This tool \
   collects all alignments between a given pair and calculates the total coverage between the query and accession number, taking into /
   account overlapping alignments. Therefore a user can figure out how much of their query sequence actually identifies with a subject /
   sequence (acc #). This tool was designed for use in the VGP decontamination pipeline - in particular for deciding whether a scaffold /
   (sequence) is of mitochondrial origin. Parse_mito_blast generates a synthesized, tabular report of coverage for scaffolds with >95% /
   identity to a mitochondrial subject sequence.
