long_description: |
  Removes residual adapter sequences from single-end (SE) or paired-end (PE) FASTQ reads, optionally trimming
  Ns and low qualities bases and/or collapsing overlapping paired-end mates into one read. Low quality reads
  are filtered based on the resulting length and the number of ambigious nucleotides ('N') present following
  trimming. These operations may be combined with simultaneous demultiplexing using 5' barcode sequences.
  Alternatively, AdapterRemoval may attempt to reconstruct a consensus adapter sequences from paired-end data,
  in order to allow the identification of the adapter sequences originally used.
