  Minimap2 is a versatile sequence alignment program that aligns DNA or mRNA
  sequences against a large reference database. Typical use cases include (1)
  mapping PacBio or Oxford Nanopore genomic reads to the human genome; (2)
  finding overlaps between long reads with error rate up to ~15%; (3)
  splice-aware alignment of PacBio Iso-Seq or Nanopore cDNA or Direct RNA reads
  against a reference genome; (4) aligning Illumina single- or paired-end
  reads; (5) assembly-to-assembly alignment; (6) full-genome alignment between
  two closely related species with divergence below ~15%.
  For ~10kb noisy reads sequences, minimap2 is tens of times faster than
  mainstream long-read mappers such as BLASR, BWA-MEM, NGMLR and GMAP. It is more
  accurate on simulated long reads and produces biologically meaningful alignment
  ready for downstream analyses. For >100bp Illumina short reads, minimap2 is
  three times as fast as BWA-MEM and Bowtie2, and as accurate on simulated data
