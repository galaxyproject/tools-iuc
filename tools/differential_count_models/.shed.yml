  edgeR, DESeq2 and voom for replicate RNA seq data.

  1) TURN OFF HTML SANITIZATION in universe_wsgi.xml or your outputs will lack proper
  style sheets and look awful

  2) This packages dependencies include R and bioconductor so expect your proxy to
  time out during the installation - be patient - it takes 10 to 30 minutes to download
  and compile everything, depending on the velocity of your machine and the interwebs
  - about 20 minutes on my laptop.

  3) make sure you have a $TMP set in your environment or ghostscript gets unhappy
  - you'll see a warning every time you run this tool if you've forgotten.
