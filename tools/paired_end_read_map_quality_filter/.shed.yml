  Contains a tool that filters a BAM file on the MAPQ (mapping quality), retaining the reads
  of MAPQ score pairs in the following cases: 1) A sequence mapping quality is greater than 5
  2) Read1 > 5 and Read2 = 0 3) Read1 = 0 and Read2 > 5.  This tool overcomes a current limitation
  of SAMtools, which does not support the MAPQ filter using both Reads' MAPQ scores.
