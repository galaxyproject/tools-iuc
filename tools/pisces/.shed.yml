  Pisces is a variant calling application, tuned for amplicons and enrichment panels. By default, calls low frequency somatic variants, but it also supports germline calling. Pisces is a "software suite" that has several executables: Stitcher - Stitches two paired reads together into a single read; Pisces - Calls small variants; Scylla - Detects multiple nucleotide variants (MNVs) in a given sample and phases the variants in complex regions into sub populations; VariantQualityRecalibration - Recalibrates the variant quality scores (Q scores) if the particular variants are over represented.
