                               directory containing BAM files. No default value.


COMMON:
      --minbasequality <INT> INT Minimum basecall quality required to use a 
                               base of the read.  Default is 10.

                               realignment target.  Default is 0.01 (1%)

      --maxrealignshift <INT>

                               discarded and the original alignment will be 
                               kept. Default value is 250.

                               alignments when comparing them.
      --usealignmentscorer <BOOL>
                             BOOL When comparing alignments, whether to use

                               softclip, and indel in that order. Alignment 
                               scoring is a simple additive function with that 
                               sums the product of each feature with its

                               mismatch, and 0 for all others, but can be tuned 
                               with the Alignment Scorer Parameters as
