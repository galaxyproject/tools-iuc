========================
Galaxy wrapper for MACS2
========================

With the improvement of sequencing techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation 
followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is getting popular to study 
genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. To address the lack of powerful ChIP-Seq 
analysis method, we present a novel algorithm, named Model-based Analysis of 
ChIP-Seq (MACS), for identifying transcript factor binding sites. MACS captures 
the influence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP 
regions, and MACS improves the spatial resolution of binding sites through 
combining the information of both sequencing tag position and orientation. 
MACS can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data alone, or with control sample with the increase of specificity.
