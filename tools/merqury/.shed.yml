description: Merqury is a tool for evaluating genomes assemblies based of k-mer operations.
long_description: |
   Merqury allows a reference-free assembly evaluation based on efficient k-mer set operations. By comparing k-mers in a de novo assembly to those found in unassembled high-accuracy reads, Merqury estimates base-level accuracy and completeness.
