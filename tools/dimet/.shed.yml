long_description: 'DIMet is a bioinformatics pipeline for differential and time-course analysis of targeted isotope-labeled metabolomics data. DIMet supports the differential analysis of targeted tracer metabolomics data, which is offered in three modes: (i) pairwise differential analysis, (ii) time-course, or (iii) multigroup analysis. To do so, DIMet accepts three types of measures: a) isotopologues quantifications, b) fractional contributions (also known as mean enrichment), c) full metabolites abundances. Our tool also performs visualizations of these types of data. Moreover, DIMet offers a pathway-based omics integration between Transcriptomics and Isotope-labeled targeted Metabolomics, using Metabolograms.'
