long_description: |
  Transcriptional regulation is carried out by transcription associated proteins (TAPs),
  comprising transcription factors (TFs, binding in sequence-specific manner to cis-regulatory
  elements to enhance or repress transcription), transcriptional regulators (TRs, acting as
  part of the transcription core complex, via unspecific binding, protein-protein interaction
  or chromatin modification) and putative TAPs (PTs), the role of which needs to be determined.
