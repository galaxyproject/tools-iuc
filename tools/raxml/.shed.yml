long_description: |
  Phylogenies are increasingly used in all fields of medical and biological research.
  Moreover, because of the next generation sequencing revolution, datasets used
  for conducting phylogenetic analyses grow at an unprecedented pace.
  RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a popular program for phylogenetic analyses
  of large datasets under maximum likelihood.
