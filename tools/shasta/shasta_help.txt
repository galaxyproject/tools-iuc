                                        control the number of iterations.
  --MinHash.alignmentCandidatesPerRead arg (=20)
                                        If --MinHash.minHashIterationCount is 
                                        0, MinHash iteration is stopped when

                                        small runs because it is very time

                                        discarded and not used to compute the

                                        alignment method 3).

                                        or FASTQ header are checked. If their 
                                        difference, in absolute value, is less 
                                        than the value of this option, the 
                                        alignment is suppressed. This can help 
                                        avoid assembly artifact. This check is 
                                        only done if the two reads have 
                                        identical meta data fields "runid", 
                                        "sampleid", and "ch". If any of these 
                                        meta data fields are missing, this 
                                        check is suppressed and this option has
                                        no effect.

                                        to zero to entirely suppress
