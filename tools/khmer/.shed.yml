  khmer is a library and suite of command line tools for working with DNA
  sequence. It is primarily aimed at short-read sequencing data such as that
  produced by the Illumina platform. khmer takes a k-mer-centric approach to
  sequence analysis, hence the name.

  The official repository is at https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer
  and you can read the docs online here: http://khmer.readthedocs.org/
