  IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR is an easy-to use-R package that enables statistical identification of isoform switching from RNA-seq derived quantification of novel and/or annotated full-length isoforms. IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR facilitates integration of many sources of (predicted) annotation such as Open Reading Frame (ORF/CDS), protein domains (via Pfam), signal peptides (via SignalP), Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDR, via NetSurfP-2 or IUPred2A), coding potential (via CPAT or CPC2) and sensitivity to Non-sense Mediated Decay (NMD) and more. The combination of identified isoform switches and their annotation enables IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR to predict potential functional consequences of the identified isoform switches — such as loss of protein domains — thereby identifying isoform switches of particular interest. Lastly, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR provides article-ready visualization methods for isoform switches for individual genes as well as both summary statistics and visualization of the genome-wide changes/consequences of isoform switches, their consequences and the associated alternative splicing.
