description: Align a protein sequence against a genome with affine gap penalty, splicing and frameshift.
long_description: |
  Miniprot aligns a protein sequence against a genome with affine gap penalty, splicing and frameshift. 
  It is primarily intended for annotating protein-coding genes in a new species using known genes from 
  other species. Miniprot is similar to GeneWise and Exonerate in functionality but it can map proteins 
  to whole genomes and is much faster at the residue alignment step.
