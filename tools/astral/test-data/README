**Song et al**:  
We include here sample input files based on the [Song et al.](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/37/14942.short) dataset of 37 mammalian species and 442 genes. 
We have removed 23 problematic genes (21 mislabeled genes and 2 genes we classified as outliers) and 
we have also re-estimated gene trees using RAxML on the alignments that authors of that paper kindly provided to us. 
We have also included 200 replicates of bootstrapped gene trees for the gene trees we estimated on the Song et al. dataset. 

**Simulation**:
We have included simulations based on the Song et al. dataset with increases rates of ILS. 

**primates:**
We have also created a reduced version of the Song et al. dataset with 9 primates, tree shrews, and 4 other mammalian taxa. This dataset is provided for testing the exact version. 

**14 taxon simulation:**
Simulated used SimPhy with extreme levels of ILS

**100-taxon simulations:**
A simulated dataset with 100 taxa and 2500 bootstrap replicate gene trees is also provided for testing large datasets.
