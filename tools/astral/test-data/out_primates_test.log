  [--help]
        Prints this help message.

  (-i|--input) <input file>
        a file containing input gene trees in newick format. (required)

  [(-o|--output) <output file>]
        a filename for storing the output species tree. Defaults to outputting
        to stdout.

  [(-q|--score-tree) <score species trees>]
        score the provided species tree and exit

  [(-t|--branch-annotate) <branch annotation level>]
        How much annotations should be added to each branch: 0, 1, or 2. 
        0: no annotations. 
        1: only the quartet support for the main resolution. 
        2: full annotation (quartet support, quartet frequency, and posterior
        probability for all three alternatives, plus total number of quartets
        around the branch and effective number of genes).
        3 (default): only the posterior probability for the main resolution.
        4: three alternative posterior probabilities.
        8: three alternative quartet scores.
        16/32: hidden commands useful to create a file called freqQuad.csv.
        10: p-values of a polytomy null hypothesis test. (default: 3)

  [(-b|--bootstraps) <bootstraps>]
        perform multi-locus bootstrapping using input bootstrap replicate files
        (use --rep to change the number of replications). The file given with
        this option should have a list of the gene tree bootstrap files, one per
        line, and each line corresponding to one gene. By default performs
        site-only resampling, but gene/site resampling can also be used. 

  [(-r|--reps) <replicates>]
        Set the number of bootstrap replicates done in multi-locus
        bootstrapping.  (default: 100)

  [(-s|--seed) <seed>]
        Set the seed number used in multi-locus bootstrapping.  (default: 692)

  [-g|--gene-resampling]
        perform gene tree resampling in addition to site resampling. Useful only
        with the -b option.

  [--gene-only]
        perform bootstrapping but only with gene tree resampling. Should not be
        used with the -b option.

  [(-k|--keep) <keep>]
        -k completed: outputs completed gene trees (i.e. after adding missing
        taxa) to a file called [output file name].completed_gene_trees.
        -k completed_norun: outputs completed gene trees (i.e. after adding
        missing taxa) to a file called [output file name].completed_gene_trees.
        -k bootstraps: outputs individual bootstrap replicates to a file called
        [output file name].[i].bs
        -k bootstraps_norun: just like -k bootstraps, but exits after outputting
        bootstraps.
        -k searchspace_norun: outputs the search space and exits; use -k
        searchspace to continue the run after outputting the search space.When
        -k option is used, -o option needs to be given. The file name specified
        using -o is used as the prefix for the name of the extra output files.

  [--outgroup <outgroup>]
        choose a single species to be used as outgroup FOR DISPLAY PUROPSES ONLY
        (has no effect on the actual unrooted tree inferred) 

  [(-c|--lambda) <lambda>]
        Set the lambda parameter for the Yule prior used in the calculations of
        branch lengths and posterior probabilities. Set to zero to get ML branch
        lengths instead of MAP. Higher values tend to shorten estimated branch
        lengths and very high values can give inaccurate results (or even result
        in underflow). (default: 0.5)

  [(-a|--namemapfile) <mapping file>]
        a file containing the mapping between names in gene tree and names in
        the species tree. The mapping file has one line per species, with one of
        two formats:
        species: gene1,gene2,gene3,gene4
        species 4 gene1 gene2 gene3 gene4

  [(-m|--minleaves) <minleaves>]
        Remove genes with less than specified number of leaves 

  [--samplingrounds <samplingrounds>]
        For multi-individual datasets, perform these many rounds of individual
        sampling for building the set X. The program automatically picks this
        parameter if not provided or if below one.

  [(-w|--generepeat) <gene repetition>]
        the number of trees sampled for each locus.  (default: 1)

  [--polylimit <polylimit>]
        Sets a limit for size of polytomies in greedy consensus trees where O(n)
        number of new  resolutions are added. ASTRAL-III sets automatic limits
        to guarantee polynomial time running time.

  [-x|--exact]
        find the exact solution by looking at all clusters - recommended only
        for small (<18) number of taxa.

  [-R|--rename]
        Simply rename gene trees according to species names given with -a; using
        the output can save memory as opposed to using the original file.

  [(-p|--extraLevel) <extraLevel>]
        How much extra bipartitions should be added: 0, 1, or 2. 0: adds nothing
        extra. 1 (default): adds to X but not excessively (greedy resolutions).
        2: adds a potentially large number and therefore can be slow (quadratic
        distance-based).3: similar to default, but instead of completing input
        gene trees, it uses -f and -e as complted gene trees. (default: 1)

  [(-e|--extra) <extra trees>]
        provide extra trees (with gene labels) used to enrich the set of
        clusters searched

  [(-f|--extra-species) <extra species trees>]
        provide extra trees (with species labels) used to enrich the set of
        clusters searched

  [--remove-bipartitions <remove extra tree bipartitions>]
        removes bipartitions of the provided extra trees (with species labels)

  [(-d|--trimming) <trimming threshold>]
        trimming threshold is user's estimate on normalized score; the closer
        user's estimate is, the faster astral runs. (default: 0)
