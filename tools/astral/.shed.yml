long_description: ASTRAL is a tool for estimating a species tree given a set of unrooted
  gene trees. ASTRAL is statistically consistent under multi-species coalescent model
  (and thus is useful for handling ILS). The optimization problem solved by ASTRAL
  seeks to find the tree that maximizes the number of induced quartet trees in gene
  trees that are shared by the species tree. The optimization problem is solved exactly
  for a constrained version of the problem that restricts the search space. An exact
  solution to the unconstrained version is also implemented and can run on small datasets
  (less than 18 taxa).
