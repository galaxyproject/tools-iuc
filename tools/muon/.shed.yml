long_description: |
    muon is a Python framework designed to work with multimodal omics data. Incentified by recent advances in acquisition of multimodal data from individual cells, muon aims to provide convenience and speed to its users enabling standardised analysis while staying flexible and expandable. muon stands on the shoulders of and integrates with annotated data object specification and scanpy library for single-cell analysis in Python.
