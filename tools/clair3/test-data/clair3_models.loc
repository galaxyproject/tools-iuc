#Enter the model names in the first column and the Path in the second
#This file lists the locations and dbkeys of all the model files
#under the "models" directory (a directory that contains a directory
#for each build). This file has the format (white space characters are
#TAB characters):
#
#<unique_build_id> <display_name>	<file_path>
#
#So, all_model.loc could look something like this:
test_model	"r941_prom_hac_g360+g422"	r941_prom_hac_g360+g422
