description: Bionano scaffolding correction tool 
long_description: |
    BiSCoT is a tool that aims to improve the contiguity of scaffolds and contigs generated after a Bionano scaffolding. It looks for enzymatic labelling sites on contigs. If two distinct contigs share labels, BiSCoT merges them at the last shared site.
