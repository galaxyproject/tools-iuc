long_description: |
  SNP-sites can rapidly extract SNPs from a multi-FASTA alignment using modest resources and
  can output results in multiple formats for downstream analysis. SNPs can be extracted from
  a 8.3 GB alignment file (1,842 taxa, 22,618 sites) in 267 seconds using 59 MB of RAM and
  1 CPU core, making it feasible to run on modest computers. SNP-sites is implemented in C
  and is available under the open source license GNU GPL version 3.
