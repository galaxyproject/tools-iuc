description: A utility to split sequence files using multiple sets of barcodes
long_description: |
    Split multiple FASTQ files by matching barcodes in one or more of the
    sequence files. Barcodes in the tab-delimited barcodes.txt file are matched
    against the beginning (or end) of the specified index read(s). By default,
    barcodes must match exactly, but --mistmatches can be set higher if desired.
