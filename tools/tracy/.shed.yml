long_description: |
  Tracy is a tool for basecalling, alignment, assembly and deconvolution of Sanger chromatograms. Each of these functions is
  provided by a sub-command and each sub-command is implemented as a separate tool in this suite. The tools are:
  * tracy_basecall: Basecalling from chromatograms.
  * tracy_align: Alignment of chromatograms to reference sequence.
  * tracy_assemble: Assembly of chromatograms with or without a guiding reference sequence.
  * tracy_decompose: Deconvolution of mixed chromatograms.
