  The vSNP tools are critical components of several workflows that validate SNPs and produce annotated
  SNP tables and corresponding phylogenetic trees.

  Whole genome sequencing for disease tracing and outbreak investigations is reoutinely required for
  high-consequence disease.  The vSNP tools are critical components of several workflows that locate
  and validate SNPs in bacterial samples and produce annotated SNP tables and corresponding phylogenetic
  trees.  The tools are capable of processing very large sets of inputs and efficiently accomodate
  multiple references.
