  PACU is a workflow for whole genome sequencing based phylogeny of Illumina and ONT R9/R10 data.
  PACU stands for the Prokaryotic Awesome variant Calling Utility and is named after an omnivorous fish (that eats both
  Illumina and ONT reads).
  The output of the tool is an HTML report containing relevant information and output files such as the Newick tree.

    This suite of tools includes a utility `PACU_map' that can be used to map reads to a reference genome.
    The main script is `PACU`, which constructs a phylogeny based on input BAM files of reads mapped to a reference 
    genome.
