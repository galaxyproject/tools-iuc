description: Reconstruct haplotypes using ShoRAH in amplicon mode
long_description: 'ShoRAH is an open source project for the analysis of next generation
  sequencing data. It is designed to analyse genetically heterogeneous samples.
  Its tools are written in different programming languages and provide error
  correction, haplotype reconstruction and estimation of the frequency of the
  different genetic variants present in a mixed sample.'
