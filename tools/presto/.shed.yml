  The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) is composed of a suite of utilities to handle all stages of
  sequence processing prior to germline segment assignment. pRESTO is designed to handle either single reads or
  paired-end reads. It includes features for quality control, primer masking, annotation of reads with sequence
  embedded barcodes, generation of unique molecular identifier (UMI) consensus sequences, assembly of
  paired-end reads and identification of duplicate sequences. Numerous options for sequence sorting, sampling
  and conversion operations are also included.
