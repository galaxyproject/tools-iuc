description: Efficient inference of large prokaryotic pangenomes with PanTA.
long_description: |
   PanTA is developed with the aim to build the pangenome of a large collection of genomes and to add a set of new genomes to an existing pangenome without rebuilding the accumulated pangenome from scratch. PanTA takes as input a list of genome assemblies and their annotations. It then extracts the protein-coding regions as specified by the annotations and translates them into protein sequences.  During this process, it verifies and filters out coding regions that are incorrectly annotated while achieving an unprecedented multiple-fold reduction in both running time and memory usage for building the pangenomes of large collections.  PanTA then generates output reports according to the standards set out by Roary, which include a spreadsheet detailing the presence and absence of each gene in each isolate as well as a summary of pangenome statistics.
