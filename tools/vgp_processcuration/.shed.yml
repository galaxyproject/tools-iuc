long_description: |
  ProcessCuration is a Python-based toolkit designed to process manually curated genome assemblies for submission.
  It reconciles AGP files created in PretextView with genome assembly FASTAs, preparing them for
  database submission through renaming, reorienting, and sorting operations.

  The toolkit is part of the VGP (Vertebrate Genomes Project) curation pipeline and works in conjunction with
  tools like gfastats and MashMap.

  This suite includes three tools:
  - split_agp: Splits haplotypes and corrects haplotig duplications in AGP files
  - chromosome_assignment: Assigns chromosome names to scaffolds and generates chromosome-level sequences
  - sak_generation: Generates SAK instructions for final assembly renaming and reordering
