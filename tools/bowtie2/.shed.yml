long_description: |
  Bowtie is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing
  reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of
  about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters to relatively long (e.g. mammalian)
  genomes. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes. Bowtie
  2 outputs alignments in SAM format, enabling interoperation with a large number
  of other tools.
