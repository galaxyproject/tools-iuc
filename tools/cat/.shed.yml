description: Contig Annotation Tool (CAT)
long_description: Contig Annotation Tool (CAT) and Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) are pipelines
  for the taxonomic classification of long DNA sequences and metagenome assembled
  genomes (MAGs/bins) of both known and (highly) unknown microorganisms, as generated
  by contemporary metagenomics studies. The core algorithm of both programs involves
  gene calling, mapping of predicted ORFs against the nr protein database, and voting-based
  classification of the entire contig / MAG based on classification of the individual
  ORFs.

  A CAT reference dataset requires about 250 GB of disk space.
