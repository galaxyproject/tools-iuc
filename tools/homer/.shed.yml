  It is a collection of command line programs for UNIX-style
  operating systems written in Perl and C++. HOMER was
  primarily written as a de novo motif discovery algorithm
  and is well suited for finding 8-20 bp motifs in large scale
  genomics data. HOMER contains many useful tools for analyzing
  ChIP-Seq, GRO-Seq, RNA-Seq, DNase-Seq, Hi-C and numerous other
  types of functional genomics sequencing data sets.
