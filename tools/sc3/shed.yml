long_description: |
    Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3) is a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data.  
    SC3 achieves high accuracy and robustness by consistently integrating different clustering solutions 
    through a consensus approach. SC3 also aids biological interpretation by identifying marker genes, 
    differentially expressed genes and outlier cells.
