Cactus
======

This suite contains a wrapper for the
`Cactus <github.com/comparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus>`__ whole-genome
aligner and another wrapper for exporting the data it generates.

Requirements
------------

Cactus uses a lot of RAM. We have tested it on Galaxy using 24 GB of RAM
for a progressive alignment of three chromosome-level, 150 megabase
genomes.
