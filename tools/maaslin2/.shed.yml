long_description: |
    MaAsLin2 is the next generation of MaAsLin (Microbiome Multivariable Association with Linear Models).
    MaAsLin2 is comprehensive R package for efficiently determining multivariable association between clinical metadata and microbial meta-omics features. 
    MaAsLin2 relies on general linear models to accommodate most modern epidemiological study designs, including cross-sectional and longitudinal, along with a variety of filtering, normalization, and transform methods.
