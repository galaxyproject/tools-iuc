description: metagenomeSeq Normalization
long_description: |
   metagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it Operational Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple samples. metagenomeSeq implements both our novel normalization and statistical model accounting for under-sampling of microbial communities and may be applicable to other datatypes. The package includes useful visualization tools. metagenomeSeq has been available through Bioconductor since release 2.12.
