description: RNA-seq read simulator
long_description: |
  Polyester is an R package designed to simulate RNA sequencing experiments with differential transcript expression.
  Given a set of annotated transcripts, Polyester will simulate the steps of an RNA-seq experiment (fragmentation, reverse-complementing, and sequencing) and produce files containing simulated RNA-seq reads.
  Polyester has a built-in wrapper function to simulate a case/control experiment with differential transcript expression and biological replicates.
  Users are able to set the levels of differential expression at transcripts of their choosing.
  This means they know which transcripts are differentially expressed in the simulated dataset, so accuracy of statistical methods for differential expression detection can be analyzed.
  
  - Built-in functionality to simulate differential expression at the transcript level
  - Ability to explicitly set differential expression signal strength
  - Simulation of small datasets, since large RNA-seq datasets can require lots of time and computing resources to analyze
  - Generation of raw RNA-seq reads, as opposed to alignments or transcript-level abundance estimates
  - Transparency/open-source code
