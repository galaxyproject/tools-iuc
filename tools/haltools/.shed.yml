long_description: |
  HAL is a graph based, phylogenetically structured format for multiple genome alignments. Unlike block based formats such as MAF, it stores genomes in a hierarchy, which allows efficient handling of rearrangements, indels, ancestral states, and flexible queries across any genome or subclade.
