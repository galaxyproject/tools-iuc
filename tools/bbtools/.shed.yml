  BBTools is a suite of fast, multithreaded bioinformatics tools designed for analysis of DNA and RNA sequence data.
  BBTools can handle common sequencing file formats such as fastq, fasta, sam, scarf, fasta+qual, compressed or raw,
  with autodetection of quality encoding and interleaving. It is written in Java and works on any platform supporting
  Java, including Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows and Linux; there are no dependencies other than Java (version
  7 or higher). Program descriptions and options are shown when running the shell scripts with no parameters.
