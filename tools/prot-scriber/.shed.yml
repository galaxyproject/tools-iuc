long_description: |
  Assigns short human readable descriptions (HRD) to query biological sequences using reference candidate descriptions.
  In this, prot-scriber consumes sequence similarity search (Blast or Diamond or similar) results in tabular format.
  A customized lexical analysis is carried out on the descriptions of these Blast Hits and a resulting HRD is assigned to the query sequences.
  prot-scriber can also apply the same methodology to produce HRDs for sets of biological sequences, i.e. gene families.
