long_description: >
  OrthoFinder is a fast, accurate and comprehensive analysis tool
  for comparative genomics. It finds orthologues and orthogroups infers gene trees
  for all orthogroups and infers a rooted species tree for the species being analysed.
  OrthoFinder also provides comprehensive statistics for comparative genomic analyses
