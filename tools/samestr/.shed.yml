description: Strain-level analysis and comparison of metagenomic samples
long_description: |
  SameStr is a tool for identifying shared microbial strains across metagenomic
  samples using clade-specific markers from MetaPhlAn or mOTUs. Unlike methods
  that only consider majority variants, SameStr analyzes all nucleotide variants
  in alignments to detect strain sharing with higher sensitivity.
