description: "Tools for analyzing genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) using COBRApy and related libraries."
long_description: |
  This repository contains a collection of Galaxy tools for performing various analyses on genome-scale
  metabolic models (GEMs). The tools leverage COBRApy and other Python libraries to provide functionalities
  such as phenotype phase plane analysis, gene knockout analysis, flux variability analysis, and more.
