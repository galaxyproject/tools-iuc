  medaka is a tool to create a consensus sequence from nanopore sequencing data. 
  This task is performed using neural networks applied from a pileup of individual 
  sequencing reads against a draft assembly. It outperforms graph-based methods 
  operating on basecalled data, and can be competitive with state-of-the-art 
  signal-based methods, whilst being much faster.
