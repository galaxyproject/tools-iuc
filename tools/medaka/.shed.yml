  medaka is a tool to create a consensus sequence from nanopore sequencing data.
  This task is performed using neural networks applied from a pileup of
  individual sequencing reads against a draft assembly. It outperforms
  graph-based methods operating on basecalled data, and can be competitive with
  state-of-the-art signal-based methods, whilst being much faster.
