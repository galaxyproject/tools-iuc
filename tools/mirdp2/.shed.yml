description: Identify miRNA genes in plant species
long_description: |
  Based on ultra-deep sampling of small RNA libraries by next 
  generation sequencing, miRDP2 is able to identify miRNA genes 
  in plant species, even for those without detailed annotation, 
  with extremely high speed and reliable performance.
