consolidateWindows: output filter doesn't work...because of section?
					no test data for mergeWindows_select.sign_select AND consolidateWindows.sign_list_select
					findOverlaps_select : cannot pass in the parameters: query and subject...already part of the function?
detailRanges: Not sure if the inputs for orgdb and txdb are fixed or for users to input
filterWindows: windowsCount tests -- do everything? Repeated tests for readparam, etc..
			   new data after filter is a windowCounts object -- save output as R object?
			   filter not working

*Should I write comments for the R scripts?
*wrapper name for concatenated functions?

TODO:
Add named boolean parameter to the tests of GRanges before extractReads
Test keep in filterWindows
filterWindow: regionCount as rangedS object

*consolidateWindows and consolidateTests in one wrapper
*correlateReads and maximizedCcf in one wrapper
