consolidateWindows: output filter doesn't work...because of section?

					no test data for mergeWindows_select.sign_select AND consolidateWindows.sign_list_select
					findOverlaps_select : cannot pass in the parameters: query and subject...already part of the function?

detailRanges: Not sure if the inputs for orgdb and txdb are fixed or for users to input

filterWindows: 
			   new data after filter is a windowCounts object -- save output as R object?
			   filter not working

normOffsets: output and return rangedsummarized experiment (R object)

*Should I write comments for the R scripts?
*wrapper name for concatenated functions?
* 27 wrappers: ~how many to concatenate?
*tool version keeps changing


TODO:
Add named boolean parameter to the tests of GRanges before extractReads
Test keep in filterWindows
filterWindow: regionCount as rangedS object

*consolidateWindows and consolidateTests in one wrapper
*correlateReads and maximizedCcf in one wrapper
