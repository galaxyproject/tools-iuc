  MerCat2 (“Mer - Catenate2”) is a versatile, parallel, scalable and 
  modular property software package for robustly analyzing features 
  in omics data. Using massively parallel sequencing raw reads, assembled contigs, 
  and protein sequences from any platform as input, MerCat2 performs k-mer counting 
  of any length k, resulting in feature abundance counts tables, quality control reports, 
  protein feature metrics, ecological diversity metrics, and graphical representation (i.e., PCA).
