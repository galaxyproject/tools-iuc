description: GSEA-based pathway enrichment analysis for multi-omics data
homepage_url: https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/multiGSEA.html
long_description: |
    The multiGSEA allows to perform robust GSEA-based pathway enrichment for multiple omics layers. The 
    enrichment is calculated for each omics layer separately and aggregated p-values are calculated afterwards 
    to derive a composite multi-omics pathway enrichment.
