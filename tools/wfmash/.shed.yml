  wfmash is an aligner for pangenomes that combines efficient homology mapping with base-level alignment. wfmash is the key algorithm in pggb (the PanGenome Graph Builder), where it is applied to make an all-to-all alignment of input genomes that defines the base structure of the pangenome graph. It can scale to support the all-to-all alignment of hundreds of human genomes.
