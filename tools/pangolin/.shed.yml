description:  Pangolin assigns SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences their most likely lineages under the Pango nomenclature system.
long_description: Pangolin uses a multinomial logistic regression model to classify SARS-CoV-2 query genomes into known Pango outbreak lineages. It reads genomes in FASTA format and produces lineage outputs in tabular format.  The model was trained on curated results from a global maximum likelihood tree of 30,000 genomes made available by GISAID.
