    Porechop - Finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads
long_description: |
    Porechop is a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads.
    Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in
    its middle, it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads. Porechop
    performs thorough alignments to effectively find adapters, even at low sequence
    identity. Porechop also supports demultiplexing of Nanopore reads that were
    barcoded with the Native Barcoding Kit, PCR Barcoding Kit or Rapid Barcoding Kit.
