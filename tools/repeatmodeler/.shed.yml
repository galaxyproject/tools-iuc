  RepeatModeler is a de novo transposable element (TE) family identification and modeling package.
  At the heart of RepeatModeler are three de-novo repeat finding programs ( RECON, RepeatScout and LtrHarvest/Ltr_retriever )
  which employ complementary computational methods for identifying repeat element boundaries and
  family relationships from sequence data.
