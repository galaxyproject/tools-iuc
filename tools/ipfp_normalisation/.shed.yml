description: Normalisation algorithm used to adjust matrices iteratively to satisfy specific row and column sum constraints while preserving the data structure.
long_description: |
  IPFP normalisation is an iterative algorithm used to adjust a contingency table or matrix so that its rows and columns have a mean value of one. The method alternates between scaling rows and columns proportionally, maintaining the structure of the data while converging to the desired outcome.
