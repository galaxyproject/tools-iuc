[2m    Polypolish is a tool for polishing genome assemblies with short reads.
Unlike other tools in this category, Polypolish uses SAM files where each read
has been aligned to all possible locations (not just a single best location).
This allows it to repair errors in repeat regions that other alignment-based
polishers cannot fix.[0m

Polypolish version: 0.5.0

[2m    For each position in the assembly, Polypolish determines the read depth
at that position and collects all aligned bases. It then polishes the assembly
by looking for positions where the pileup unambiguously supports a different
sequence than the assembly.[0m
