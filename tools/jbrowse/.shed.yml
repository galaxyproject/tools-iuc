description: JBrowse Genome Browser integrated as a Galaxy Tool
long_description: |
  JBrowse is a fast, extensible JS+HTML5 genome browser.

  This repository contains a couple of tools aimed at building up a complete
  JBrowse Genome Browser deployment from raw data files such as gff3, bed, bam,
  vcf, blastxml, and more...

  The tools produce a ready-to-deploy HTML file and associated processed
  datasets, allowing visualization of the genome either from within Galaxy, or
  outside of Galaxy.

  The tool must be whitelisted for HTML content. If BAM files are displayed, it
  must be served from an apache or nginx server implementing sendfile.
