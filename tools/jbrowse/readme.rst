JBrowse in Galaxy
=================

    JBrowse is a fast, embeddable genome browser built completely with
    JavaScript and HTML5

Thus, it makes an ideal fit with Galaxy, especially for use as a
workflow summary. E.g. annotate a genome, then visualise all of the
associated datasets as an interactive HTML page. This tool MUST be whitelisted
(or ``sanitize_all_html=False`` in galaxy.ini) to function correctly.

Installation
============

It is recommended to install this wrapper via the Galaxy Tool Shed.

Running Locally
===============

The Galaxy tool interface writes out a xml file which is then used to generate
the visualizations. An example used during development/testing can be seen in
`test-data/*/test.xml`. The format is in no way rigorously defined and is
likely to change at any time! Beware. ;)
