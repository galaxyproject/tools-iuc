description: Toolkit for phylogenetic trees and distance matrices from VCF and FASTA
long_description: |
  Galaxy wrappers for fastreeR - a toolkit for phylogenetic trees and distance matrices from VCF and FASTA files. It includes the following tools that provide efficient methods for constructing distance matrices and phylogenetic trees from genetic data in VCF and FASTA formats:
    - VCF2DIST (Build cosine distance matrix from VCF(s)),
    - VCF2TREE (Build neighbor joining phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) from VCF(s)),
    - FASTA2DIST (Build D2S distance matrix from FASTA(s)),
    - DIST2TREE (Build neighbor joining phylogenetic tree from distance matrix).
