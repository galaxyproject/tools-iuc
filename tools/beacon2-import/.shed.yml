description: Beacon Import uploads local genetic data to the server, while Beacon Query searches for genetic information such as genes, sequences, and variants.
long_description: Beacon Import facilitates the seamless transfer of local genetic data to the server, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing. Meanwhile,
       Beacon Query empowers users to efficiently explore the server for specific genetic information, including genes, sequences, variants, cnv, and genomic ranges. The search
       tools also search the phenopacket and other metadata B2RI collections (individuals, runs, datasets, biosamples, cohorts and analyses),
      catalyzing genomic research and clinical applications.
