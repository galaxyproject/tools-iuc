    **Input**
    This tool requires a collection of FCS files as input.
    Input files **MUST** have the same markers *and* channels. The following tools in the FCS Files tool section can help harmonize channels and/or markers in the FCS files collection:

    - Get list of markers or channels in FCS files.
    - Edit markers or channels in FCS files

    **Downsampling**

    By default, files are downsampled to 10% of the total number of events across input files. If a downsampling factor is provided, each file in the input dataset collection will be downsampled randomly without replacement as follows:

    - If n is between 0 and 1, the size of the output will be n times that of the input files.
    - If n is between 1 and 100, the size of the output will be n% that of the input files.

    Downsampling is implemented such that each file will contribute an equal number of event to the aggregate.

    **Output**
    The output file contains an aggregation of events from the input files provided all are valid FCS files. If a downsampling factor is provided, the corresponding proportion of each input file ONLY will be read in. Output can be provided in FCS format or in a RData object containing a flowFrame.
