    **Input**
    Tool input is a tab-separated file containing markers fluorescence intensities for each event as well as population, for instance generated as part of FLOCK, FlowSOM or CrossSample run. If the option is selected, flowCL is used to associate populations defined by FLOCK to a Cell Ontology term. This option is not available for FlowSOM runs. Marker names do need to be in the Cell Ontology for flowCL to run.

    **Output**
    The output is an interactive page with multiple tabs that allows visualization of the data.
