description: downsamples and merges multiple txt-converted FCS files into one text file
long_description: |
    **Input**
    This tool requires collections of txt, flowtext or tabular files as input.
    By default, files are not downsampled. If a downsampling factor is provided, each file in the input dataset collection will be downsampled randomly without replacement as follows:

    - If n is between 0 and 1, the size of the output will be n times that of the input files.
    - If n is between 1 and 100, the size of the output will be n% that of the input files.

    At this time, up-sampling is not supported. If the number provided is greater than 100, the tool will exit.

    **Output file**
    The output flowtext file contains is a concatenation of the input files provided all data after the header contains only numbers. By default, only columns existing in all input files (as assessed by the header) are concatenated. The user can specify columns to merge, bypassing the headers check. If a downsampling factor is provided, the corresponding proportion of each input file ONLY will be read in (and checked for errors)
