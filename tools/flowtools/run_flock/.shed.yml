description: runs FLOCK using a FCS file that was converted to a text file
long_description: |
    FLOCK (FLOw Clustering without K) is a computational approach to flow cytometry analysis which:

    1. Computationally determines the number of unique populations in high dimensional flow data using a rapid binning approach
    2. Can handle non-spherical hyper-shapes
    3. Maps populations across independent samples
    4. Calculates many useful summary statistics
    5. Finds the most informative parameters
    6. Reduces subjective factors in manual gating

    **Input**
    FLOCK requires a text file, generated from a FCS file, as input.
    In order to define the populations in a given dataset collection for a given set of markers, run FLOCK on a super-set of FCS file. Use the Downsample and merge tool to concatenate and/or downsample datasets, and remove, edit or rearrange markers before running FLOCK on your favorite set of markers.

    **Output**
    FLOCK attributes each event to a population and generates a text file.
    The centroid file is a table containing the mean, median or geometric mean fluorescent intensity values of each marker within each population defined by FLOCK, as determined by the user.
    The population score output is a table containing marker scores for each population. The score value is a number indicating the degree to which this population expresses each marker, as follows:

    - 1 implies negative expression
    - 2 implies low expression
    - 3 implies positive expression
    - 4 implies highly positive expression
