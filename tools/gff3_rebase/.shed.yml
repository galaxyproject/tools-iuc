long_description: |
  Often the genomic data processing/analysis process requires a workflow like the following:

  -  select some features from a genome
  -  export the sequences associated with those regions
  -  analyse those exports with some tool like Blast

  For display, especially in software like JBrowse, it is convenient to know
  where in the original genome the analysis results would fall. E.g. if a
  transmembrane domain is detected at bases 10-20 of an analysed protein, where
  should this be displayed relative to the parent genome?

  This tool helps fill that gap, by rebasing some analysis results against the
  parent features which were originally analysed.
