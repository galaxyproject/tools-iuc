  LoFreq is a fast and sensitive variant-caller for inferring SNVs and indels
  from next-generation sequencing data. It makes full use of base-call qualities
  and other sources of errors inherent in sequencing (e.g. mapping or base/indel
  alignment uncertainty), which are usually ignored by other methods or only
  used for filtering.
