description: "Ensembl VEP: Annotate VCFs with variant effect predictions"
long_description: |
    The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) is able to determine the effect of 
    variants (e.g. SNPs, insertions or deletions) on genes, transcripts, protein 
    sequences and regulatory regions. Given the coordinates and nucleotide changes 
    of a variant, it outputs affected genes, the exact location and consequences 
    of the variant as well as known variants matching this one.
