Usage Guidelines and Requirements
=================================

Frequency, Timing, and Registration of E-utility URL Requests
-------------------------------------------------------------

In order not to overload the E-utility servers, NCBI recommends that users
limit large jobs to either weekends or between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM Eastern time
during weekdays. Failure to comply with this policy may result in an IP address
being blocked from accessing NCBI.

Minimizing the Number of Requests
---------------------------------

If a task requires searching for and/or downloading a large number of
records, it is much more efficient to use the Entrez History to upload
and/or retrieve these records in batches rather than using separate
requests for each record. Please refer to Application 3 in Chapter 3
for an example. Many thousands of IDs can be uploaded using a single
EPost request, and several hundred records can be downloaded using one
EFetch request.


Disclaimer and Copyright Issues
-------------------------------

the following disclaimer:
