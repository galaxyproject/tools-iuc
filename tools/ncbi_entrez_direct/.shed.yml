  Entrez E-Utils provide an interface to the NCBI databases to allow querying
  and downloading datasets from NCBI

  This repo requires that administrators should very aware of some
  restrictions NCBI places on the use of the Entrez service.
  
  NCBI requests that you please limit large jobs to either weekends or
  between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM Eastern time during weekdays. This is not a
  request that the Galaxy tool can easily service, so we've included it in
  the disclaimer on every tool quite prominently.
  
  Failure to comply with NCBI's policies may result in an block until
  you/the user contacts NCBI and registers the tool ID and their email.
  
  Note that these are *IP* level blocks so the Galaxy tools uses a
  concatenation of the administrator's emails, and the user email, in
  hopes that NCBI will contact all relevant parties should their system be
  abused.
