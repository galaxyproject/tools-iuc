Galaxy NCBI Entrez Direct Tools
===============================

This repo requires a readme as administrators should very aware of some
restrictions NCBI places on the use of the Entrez service.

NCBI requests that you please limit large jobs to either weekends or
between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM Eastern time during weekdays. This is not a
request that the Galaxy tool can easily service, so we've included it in
the disclaimer on every tool quite prominently.

Failure to comply with NCBI's policies may result in an block.

Note that these are *IP* level blocks so the Galaxy tools uses a
concatenation of the administrator's emails, and the user email, in
hopes that NCBI will contact all relevant parties should their system be
abused.
