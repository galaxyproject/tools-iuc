description: RNA STAR is an ultra fast universal RNA and scRNA-seq aligner and mapper
long_description: |
  An ultra fast universal RNA-seq aligner that can optionally perform gene-level and sample-level quantification on the fly.
  Note that while very fast, this tool requires a considerable amount of memory. As an example, hg19 requires about 30GB. See http://gettinggeneticsdone.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/star-ultrafast-universal-rna-seq-aligner.html
  Most of this wrapper was originally written by Jeremy Goecks, with kibbitzing and automated dependency installation by Ross Lazarus.
  The scRNA-seq mapping and quantification component is encapsulated within the STARSolo wrapper.
