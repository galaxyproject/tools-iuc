  WARNING! This will eat all your cluster node RAM and then some.

  hg19 uses about 30GB but it's really fast. See http://gettinggeneticsdone.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/star-ultrafast-universal-rna-seq-aligner.html

  You also need a new set of genome indexes. Sigh. So you have to build those yourself.

  Most of this wrapper was originally written by Jeremy Goecks, with kibbitzing and
  automated dependency installation by Ross Lazarus.
