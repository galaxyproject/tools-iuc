description: for using multi-locus genotype data to investigate population structure.
long_description: |
  The program structure is a free software package for using multi-locus genotype data to 
  investigate population structure. Its uses include inferring the presence of distinct 
  populations, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, identifying 
  migrants and admixed individuals, and estimating population allele frequencies in 
  situations where many individuals are migrants or admixed. It can be applied to most of 
  the commonly-used genetic markers, including SNPS, microsatellites, RFLPs and AFLPs.
