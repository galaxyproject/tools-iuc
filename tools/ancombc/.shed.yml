description: Performs analysis of compositions of microbiomes with bias correction.
long_description: |
  Determine taxa whose absolute abundances, per unit volume, of the ecosystem (e.g. gut)
  are significantly different with changes in the covariate of interest (e.g. group). The
  current version of ancombc function implements Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes
  with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC) in cross-sectional data while allowing for covariate
  adjustment.
