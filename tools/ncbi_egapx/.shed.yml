  EGAPx is the publicly accessible version of the updated NCBI Eukaryotic
  Genome Annotation Pipeline. EGAPx takes an assembly fasta file, a
  taxid of the organism, and RNA-seq data. Based on the taxid, EGAPx will
  pick protein sets and HMM models. The pipeline runs miniprot to align
  protein sequences, and STAR to align RNA-seq to the assembly. Protein
  alignments and RNA-seq read alignments are then passed to Gnomon for
  gene prediction. In the first step of Gnomon, the short alignments
  are chained together into putative gene models. In the second step,
  these predictions are further supplemented by ab-initio predictions
  based on HMM models. The final annotation for the input assembly is
  produced as a gff file.
