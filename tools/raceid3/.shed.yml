long_description: |
  RaceID is a method for cell type identification from single-cell RNA-seq data by unsupervised learning. An initial clustering is followed by an outlier identification based on a backgorund model of combined technical and biological variability in single-cell RNA-seq data obtained by quantification with unique molecular identifiers. StemID permits subsequent inference of a lineage tree based on clusters, i.e. cell types, identified by RaceID.
