homepage_url: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EGSEA.html
long_description: |
  The EGSEA algorithm takes RNA-seq count data as input and utilizes twelve prominent Gene Set Enrichment 
  algorithms to calculate collective significance scores for gene sets from MSigDB, GeneSetDB and KEGG. 
  Supported organisms are human, mouse and rat.
