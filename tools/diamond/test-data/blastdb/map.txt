# file used to store protein IDs to taxids
# diamond expects 1234 in the tax data: https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/blob/56214dfcb4278f08e935147e8dbea7672997386e/src/data/blastdb/blastdb.cpp#L170
# more precisely in the taxdb.bt* files (which are here constructed from the dmp files)
# we also add the path to the root (guess not needed strictly)
# ideally 1234 should also in the sqlite DB, but since the taxon is not in the fasta it should be fine
