long_description: DIAMOND_ is a new alignment tool for aligning short DNA sequencing reads to a protein reference database such as NCBI-NR. On Illumina reads of length 100-150bp, in fast mode, DIAMOND is about 20,000 times faster than BLASTX, while reporting about 80-90% of all matches that BLASTX finds, with an e-value of at most 1e-5. In sensitive mode, DIAMOND ist about 2,500 times faster than BLASTX, finding more than 94% of all matches. http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/software/diamond/
