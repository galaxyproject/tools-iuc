description: PEAR evaluates all possible paired-end read overlaps
long_description: |
  PEAR evaluates all possible paired-end read overlaps and without requiring the target fragment size as input. In addition, it implements a statistical test for 
  minimizing false-positive results. Together with a highly optimized implementation, it can merge millions of paired end reads within a couple of minutes on a 
  standard desktop computer. Repository-Maintainer: Björn Grüning
