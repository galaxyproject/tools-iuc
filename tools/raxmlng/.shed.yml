long_description: |
  RAxML-NG is a phylogenetic tree inference tool which uses Maximum-Likelihood (ML) optimality criterion.
  Its search heuristic is based on iteratively performing a series of Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) moves, 
  which allows to quickly navigate to the best-known ML tree. 
  RAxML-NG is a successor of RAxML 8.x (Stamatakis 2014).
