long_description: |
  PIMENTO is a PrIMEr infereNce TOolkit designed to facilitate large-scale calling of metabarcoding amplicon sequence variants. It employs a dual primer inference strategy: one based on fuzzy regular expression searches against a curated library of standard primer sequences, and another that predicts primer cutoff points by analyzing base-conservation patterns at the start and end of sequencing reads to generate consensus sequences as inferred primers. Additionally, PIMENTO includes a function to predict the presence of primers when no standard sequences are found, making it especially useful in large-scale analysis pipelines where manual checking is impractical.
