  Nanocompore compares 2 ONT nanopore direct RNA sequencing datasets from different experimental conditions expected to have a significant impact on RNA modifications. It is recommended to have at least 2 replicates per condition. For example one can use a control condition with a significantly reduced number of modifications such as a cell line for which a modification writing enzyme was knocked-down or knocked-out. Alternatively, on a smaller scale transcripts of interests could be synthesized in-vitro.
