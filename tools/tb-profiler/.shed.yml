#    description: "Predict M. tuberculosis lineage and drug resistance from sequences in FASTQ or BAM"
#    long_description: |
#      This tool computes a drug resistance and lineage profile from M. tuberculosis whole genome
#      sequencing (WGS) data. 
#
#      The pipeline aligns reads to the H37Rv reference using bowtie2, BWA or minimap2
#      and then calls variants using GATK. These variants are then compared to a
#      drug-resistance database. We also predict the number of reads supporting drug
#      resistance variants as an insight into hetero-resistance (not applicable for minION data)
#

#     description: "Predict M. tuberculosis lineage and drug resistance from variants in VCF"
#     long_description: |
#       This tool (in the TB-Profiler tool suite) takes a VCF file of M. tuberculosis variants
#       (called relative to the H37Rv reference) and predicts drug resistance from these
#       variants.

#  long_description: |
#      This tool computes a drug resistance and lineage profile from M. tuberculosis whole genome
#      sequencing (WGS) data. It can either work from sequence data (the tb_profiler_profile tool)
#      or from pre-computed sequence variants in VCF format, relative to the H37Rv reference.
