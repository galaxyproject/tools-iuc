This repository contains a complete rewrite of the web version of TBProfiler, described here. It allows the use of profiling through a command line interface and contains some additional functionality such as the ability to process minION data.

The pipeline aligns reads to the H37Rv reference using bowtie2, BWA or minimap2 and then calls variants using SAMtools. These variants are then compared to a drug-resistance database. We also predict the number of reads supporting drug resistance variants as an insight into hetero-resistance (not applicable for minION data)
