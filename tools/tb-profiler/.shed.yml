description: Processes M. tuberculosis sequence data to infer strain type and identify known drug resistance markers. 
long_description: |
  TB-Profiler aligns reads to the H37Rv reference using bowtie2, BWA-MEM, BWA-MEM2 or minimap2 and then calls 
  variants (by default using freebayes). These variants are then compared to a drug-resistance database to
  predict drug resistance. For Illumina data the number of reads supporting the drug resistance variant
  is also reported.

  description: Galaxy wrapper suite for TB-Profiler profile and TB-profiler collate 
  long_description: |
    This suite contains wrappers for TB-Profiler profile and TB-Profiler collate. The TB-Profiler profile tool computes a 
    drug resistance and lineage profile from M. tuberculosis whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. 
    The TB-profiler collate tool collates multiple JSON reports generated by tb-profiler_profile.
