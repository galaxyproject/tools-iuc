    description: "Predict M. tuberculosis lineage and drug resistance from sequences in FASTQ or BAM"
    long_description: |
      This tool computes a drug resistance and lineage profile from M. tuberculosis whole genome
      sequencing (WGS) data. 

      The pipeline aligns reads to the H37Rv reference using bowtie2, BWA or minimap2
      and then calls variants using GATK. These variants are then compared to a
      drug-resistance database. We also predict the number of reads supporting drug
      resistance variants as an insight into hetero-resistance (not applicable for minION data)

    description: "Predict M. tuberculosis lineage and drug resistance from variants in VCF"
    long_description: |
      This tool (in the TB-Profiler tool suite) takes a VCF file of M. tuberculosis variants
      (called relative to the H37Rv reference) and predicts drug resistance from these
      variants.

  description: Processes M. tuberculosis sequence data to infer strain type and identify known drug resistance markers. 
  long_description: |
      This tool computes a drug resistance and lineage profile from M. tuberculosis whole genome
      sequencing (WGS) data. It can either work from sequence data (the tb_profiler_profile tool)
      or from pre-computed sequence variants in VCF format, relative to the H37Rv reference.
