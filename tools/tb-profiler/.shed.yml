description: Processes M. tuberculosis sequence data to infer strain type and identify known drug resistance markers. 
long_description: |
  TB-Profiler aligns reads to the H37Rv reference using bowtie2, BWA-MEM, BWA-MEM2 or minimap2 and then calls 
  variants (by default using freebayes). These variants are then compared to a drug-resistance database to
  predict drug resistance. For Illumina data the number of reads supporting the drug resistance variant
  is also reported.
