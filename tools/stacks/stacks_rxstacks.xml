.. class:: infomark

**What it does**

This program will run each of the Stacks components: first, running ustacks on each of the samples specified, building loci and calling SNPs in each. Second, cstacks will be run to create a catalog of all loci that were marked as 'parents' or 'samples' on the command line, and finally, sstacks will be executed to match each sample against the catalog. A bit more detail on this process can be found in the FAQ. The denovo_map.pl program will also load the results of each stage of the analysis: individual loci, the catalog, and matches against the catalog into the database (although this can be disabled). After matching, the program will build a database index to speed up access (index_radtags.pl) and enable web-based filtering.

Input files:

FASTQ, FASTA, zip, tar.gz

- Population map::

    indv_01    1
    indv_02    1
    indv_03    1
    indv_04    2
    indv_05    2
    indv_06    2


Output files:

- XXX.tags.tsv file::

    Column    Name                     Description
    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.
    2         Sample ID                Each sample passed through Stacks gets a unique id for that sample.
    3         Stack ID                 Each stack formed gets an ID.
    4         Chromosome               If aligned to a reference genome using pstacks, otherwise it is blank.
    5         Basepair                 If aligned to ref genome using pstacks.
    6         Strand                   If aligned to ref genome using pstacks.
    7         Sequence Type            Either 'consensus', 'primary' or 'secondary', see the Stacks paper for definitions of these terms.
    8         Sequence ID              The individual sequence read that was merged into this stack.
    9         Sequence                 The raw sequencing read.
    10        Deleveraged Flag         If "1", this stack was processed by the deleveraging algorithm and was broken down from a larger stack.
    11        Blacklisted Flag         If "1", this stack was still confounded depsite processing by the deleveraging algorithm.
    12        Lumberja ckstack Flag    If "1", this stack was set aside due to having an extreme depth of coverage.

Notes: For the tags file, each stack will start in the file with a consensus sequence for the entire stack followed by the flags for that stack. Then, each individual read that was merged into that stack will follow. The next stack will start with another consensus sequence.


- XXX.snps.tsv file::

    Column    Name                     Description
    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.
    2         Sample ID                
    3         Stack ID                 
    4         SNP Column               
    5         Likelihood ratio         From the SNP-calling model.
    6         Rank_1                   Majority nucleotide.
    7         Rank_2                   Alternative nucleotide.

Notes: If a stack has two SNPs called within it, then there will be two lines in this file listing each one.


- XXX.alleles.tsv file::

    Column    Name                     Description
    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.
    2         Sample ID                
    3         Stack ID                 
    4         Haplotype                The haplotype, as constructed from the called SNPs at each locus.
    5         Percent                  Percentage of reads that have this haplotype
    6         Count                    Raw number of reads that have this haplotype


- XXX.matches.tsv file::

    Column    Name                     Description
    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.
    2         Batch ID                
    3         Catalog ID                 
    4         Sample ID               
    5         Stack ID         
    6         Haplotype 
    7         Stack Depth	

Notes: Each line in this file records a match between a catalog locus and a locus in an individual, for a particular haplotype. The Batch ID plus the Catalog ID together represent a unique locus in the entire population, while the Sample ID and the Stack ID together represent a unique locus in an individual sample.
