.. class:: infomark

**What it does**

This program exports a Stacks data set either as a set of observed haplotypes at each locus in the population, or with the haplotypes encoded into genotypes. The -r option allows only loci that exist in a certain number of population individuals to be exported. In a mapping context, raising or lowering this limit is an effective way to control the quality level of markers exported as genuine markers will be found in a large number of progeny. If exporting a set of observed haplotypes in a population, the "min stack depth" option can be used to restict exported loci to those that have a minimum depth of reads.

By default, when executing the pipeline (either denovo_map or ref_map) the genotypes program will be executed last and will identify mappable markers in the population and export both a set of observed haplotypes and a set of generic genotypes with "min number of progeny" option = 1.


Making Corrections

If enabled with the "make automated corrections to the data" option, the genotypes program will make automated corrections to the data. Since loci are matched up in the population, the script can correct false-negative heterozygote alleles since it knows the existence of alleles at a particular locus in the other individuals. For example, the program will identify loci with SNPs that didn’t have high enough coverage to be identified by the SNP caller. It will also check that homozygous tags have a minimum depth of coverage, since a low-coverage polymorphic locus may appear homozygous simply because the other allele wasn’t sequenced.


Correction Thresholds

The thresholds for automatic corrections can be modified by using the "automated corrections option" and changing the default values for the "min number of reads for homozygous genotype", "homozygote minor minimum allele frequency" and "heterozygote minor minimum allele frequency" parameters to genotypes. "min number of reads for homozygous genotype" is the minimum number of reads required to consider a stack homozygous (default of 5). The "homozygote minor minimum allele frequency" and "heterozygote minor minimum allele frequency" variables represent fractions. If the ratio of the depth of the the smaller allele to the bigger allele is greater than "heterozygote minor minimum allele frequency" (default of 1/10) a stack is called a het. If the ratio is less than homozygote minor minimum allele frequency (default of 1/20) a stack is called homozygous. If the ratio is in between the two values it is unknown and a genotype will not be assigned.

Automated corrections made by the program are shown in the output file in capital letters.

Input files:

FASTQ, FASTA, zip, tar.gz

Output files:

- XXX.tags.tsv file::

    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.
    2         Sample ID                Each sample passed through Stacks gets a unique id for that sample.
    3         Stack ID                 Each stack formed gets an ID.
    4         Chromosome               If aligned to a reference genome using pstacks, otherwise it is blank.
    5         Basepair                 If aligned to ref genome using pstacks.
    6         Strand                   If aligned to ref genome using pstacks.
    7         Sequence Type            Either 'consensus', 'primary' or 'secondary', see the Stacks paper for definitions of these terms.
    8         Sequence ID              The individual sequence read that was merged into this stack.
    9         Sequence                 The raw sequencing read.
    10        Deleveraged Flag         If "1", this stack was processed by the deleveraging algorithm and was broken down from a larger stack.
    11        Blacklisted Flag         If "1", this stack was still confounded depsite processing by the deleveraging algorithm.
    12        Lumberja ckstack Flag    If "1", this stack was set aside due to having an extreme depth of coverage.

Notes: For the tags file, each stack will start in the file with a consensus sequence for the entire stack followed by the flags for that stack. Then, each individual read that was merged into that stack will follow. The next stack will start with another consensus sequence.


- XXX.snps.tsv file::

    Column    Name                     Description
    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.
    2         Sample ID
    3         Stack ID
    4         SNP Column
    5         Likelihood ratio         From the SNP-calling model.
    6         Rank_1                   Majority nucleotide.
    7         Rank_2                   Alternative nucleotide.

- XXX.alleles.tsv file::

    Column    Name                     Description
    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.
    2         Sample ID
    3         Stack ID
    4         Haplotype                The haplotype, as constructed from the called SNPs at each locus.
    5         Percent                  Percentage of reads that have this haplotype
    6         Count                    Raw number of reads that have this haplotype


- XXX.matches.tsv file::

    Column    Name                     Description
    1         Sql ID                   This field will always be "0", however the MySQL database will assign an ID when it is loaded.

    7         Stack Depth

Notes: Each line in this file records a match between a catalog locus and a locus in an individual, for a particular haplotype. The Batch ID plus the Catalog ID together represent a unique locus in the entire population, while the Sample ID and the Stack ID together represent a unique locus in an individual sample.
