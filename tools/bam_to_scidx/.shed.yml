long_description: |
  Converts BAM data to ScIdx, the Strand-specific coordinate count format, which is used by tools within
  the Chip-exo Galaxy flavor.  ScIdx files are 1-based.  The format consists of 5 columns: the chromosome,
  the position of the genomic coordinate, the number of tags on the forward strand, the number of tags on
  the reverse strand and the number of total tags on the position.  With pair-end reads, only the 5â€™ end of
  READ1 will be used to create the ScIdx data file.  Tools that use this format include GeneTrack and MultiGPS.
