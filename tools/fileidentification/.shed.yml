    Do you have a huge number of multimedia files and you don't know if they are corrupt,
    or if they have the correct extension?
    This tool:

    - gives you an overview of what file types there are
    - checks if the extension of the files match their content
    - checks if there are any duplicates
    - checks if the content of the files is intact
