Galaxy wrappers for HUMAnN2
===========================

Galaxy should be able to automatically install the dependencies, i.e. the
HUMAnN2 binaries and its dependencies.

After installation, you must tell Galaxy about the default databases for MetaPhlAn2 and HUMAnN2. 
You need to use the data managers for that and installing:

- MetaPhlAn2 database
- HUMAnN2 nucleotide database
- HUMAnN2 protein database
