  RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for *interspersed repeats* and *low complexity* DNA 
  sequences. The output of the program is a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query 
  sequence as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been 
  masked. http://www.repeatmasker.org/
