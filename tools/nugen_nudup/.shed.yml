    Marks/removes PCR introduced duplicate molecules based on the molecular tagging
    technology used in NuGEN products.

    For SINGLE END reads, duplicates are marked if they fulfill the following
    criteria: a) start at the same genomic coordinate b) have the same strand
    orientation c) have the same molecular tag sequence. The read with the
    highest mapping quality is kept as the non-duplicate read.
    
    For PAIRED END reads, duplicates are marked if they fulfill the following
    criteria: a) start at the same genomic coordinate b) have the same template
    length c) have the same molecular tag sequence. The read pair with the highest
    mapping quality is kept as the non-duplicate read.
