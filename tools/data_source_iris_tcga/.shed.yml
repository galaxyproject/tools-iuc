long_description: |
  Retrieve data from Information Retrieval and Integration System for cancer genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (IRIS-TCGA).
  IRIS-TCGA is an online web service for searching, retrieving and integrating genomic data: http://bioinf.iasi.cnr.it/iristcga/index.php.
  
  Example usage:
    I need RNASeq - gene quantification experiments about the BRCA (Breast Invasive Carcinoma) disease, and I need to differentiate experiments on tumor tissue and normal tissue without considering clinical information.
    Additionally I need to consider only the patient for which have been sequenced both the tumor tissue and the normal tissue.
    1. select the disease BRCA (please wait some seconds, this disease has a lot of metadata);
    2. insert information about the first query q1: Platform = IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeq , Data Type = RNASeq.gene , Level = Level_3 , Tissue = tumoral;
    3. add a row and insert information about the second query q2: Platform = IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeq , Data Type = RNASeq.gene , Level = Level_3 , Tissue = normal;
    4. write the following integration formula: q1âˆ©q2;
    5. submit the request clicking the "Compute" button.
