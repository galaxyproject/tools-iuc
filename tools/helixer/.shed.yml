description: Gene calling with Deep Neural Network.
long_description: |
  Helixer allows to configure and train models for de novo gene structure prediction. 
  This involves performing a "gene call" and identifying base pairs in a genome that 
  belong to the UTR/CDS/Intron of genes. Train a model for a wide variety of genomes
