  The `maplot` tool is designed to generate MA plots for visualizing data distributions. 
  It supports two backends, Plotly and Matplotlib, allowing users to create either interactive 
  or static plots. The tool provides a wide range of customizable parameters, including options 
  for LOESS smoothing, binning, scaling, and axis adjustments. Users can also choose the output 
  format (PDF, PNG, or HTML) depending on the selected backend. This tool is ideal for exploring 
  and presenting data in a clear and visually appealing manner.
