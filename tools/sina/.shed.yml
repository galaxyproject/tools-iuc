description: SINA reference based multiple sequence alignment
homepage_url: https://sina.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
long_description: SINA aligns nucleotide sequences to match a pre-existing MSA using a graph based alignment algorithm similar to PoA. The graph approach allows SINA to incorporate information from many reference sequences building without blurring highly variable regions. While pure NAST implementations depend highly on finding a good match in the reference database, SINA is able to align sequences relatively distant to references with good quality and will yield a robust result for query sequences with many close reference.
