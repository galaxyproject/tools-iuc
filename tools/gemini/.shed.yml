description: "GEMINI: a flexible framework for exploring genome variation"
long_description: |
  GEMINI (GEnome MINIng) is designed to be a flexible framework for
  exploring genetic variation in the context of the wealth of genome annotations available
  for the human genome. By placing genetic variants, sample genotypes, and useful
  genome annotations into an integrated database framework, GEMINI provides a simple,
  flexible, yet very powerful system for exploring genetic variation for for disease
  and population genetics.
