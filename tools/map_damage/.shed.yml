long_description: |
    mapDamage is a computational framework which allows for the authentication of ancient
    DNA NGS datasets through the plotting and statistical estimation of damage patterns specific
    to ancient DNA molecules. These include misincorporations due to cytosine deaminations (C to T
    and G to A), short fragment lengths, purine enrichment before strand breaks, DNA nicking, and
    overhang lengths. These patterns are visualised using R, and are estimated through Bayesian statistics.
