long_description:
    SeqPrep is a program designed to merge paired-end Illumina reads that are overlapping into a single longer read and to trim adapters.
    It is particularly useful for preparing reads for downstream applications like genome assembly and SNP calling.
    The tool works by identifying and merging reads that are overlapping and trimming adapters based on user-defined sequences or default parameters.
