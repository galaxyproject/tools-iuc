  MEGAN Community Edition - Interactive exploration and analysis of large-scale microbiome sequencing data.  MEGAN 
  is a tool for studying the taxonomic content of a set of DNA reads, typically collected in a metagenomics project.
  In a preprocessing step, a sequence alignment of all reads against a suitable database of reference DNA or protein
  sequences must be performed to produce an input file for the program. MEGAN is suitable for DNA reads (metagenome
  data), RNA reads (metatranscriptome data), peptide sequences (metaproteomics data) and, using a suitable synonyms
  file that maps SILVA ids to taxon ids, for 16S rRNA data (amplicon sequencing).
