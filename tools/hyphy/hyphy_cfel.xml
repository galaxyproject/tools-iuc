Contrast-FEL : A Test for Differences in Selective Pressures at Individual Sites among Clades and Sets of Branches
==================================================================================================================

Brief description
-----------------

Contrast-FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood) is a statistical method designed to identify individual sites within genes that experience different selective pressures among various clades or sets of branches in a phylogenetic tree. It extends the traditional Fixed Effects Likelihood (FEL) method to detect differences in ω ratios (the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates) using a likelihood-ratio test.

The intuition behind Contrast-FEL is that if different evolutionary pressures are acting on different parts of a phylogenetic tree, then the ω ratios at specific sites might vary significantly between these groups of branches. For example, a site might be under strong purifying selection in one clade but under positive selection in another. Contrast-FEL allows for the direct comparison of these selective regimes at a site-by-site level.

This method is particularly useful for testing evolutionary hypotheses that involve comparing selective pressures among predefined sets of branches. It provides site-level resolution for comparing selective pressures, which is often lacking in other approaches. Simulations have shown that Contrast-FEL offers good power and maintains control over false positive rates when the model is correctly specified.

Methodology and Intuition
-------------------------

Contrast-FEL operates by comparing evolutionary rates at individual sites across different predefined branch sets in a phylogenetic tree. The core idea is to detect shifts in selective pressure (quantified by the ω ratio, dN/dS) that are specific to certain lineages or clades.

1.  **Site-wise Likelihood Calculation:** For each site in the alignment, Contrast-FEL estimates the synonymous (α) and nonsynonymous (β) substitution rates. Crucially, it estimates a separate nonsynonymous rate (β) for each specified branch set, while the synonymous rate (α) is shared across all branches. This allows for direct comparison of selective pressures.

2.  **Hypothesis Testing:** The method then performs a likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for each site. The null hypothesis is that the ω ratios are the same across all specified branch sets for that site. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one branch set has a significantly different ω ratio.

3.  **Permutation Testing (Optional):** To account for potential biases and improve the robustness of significance calls, Contrast-FEL can perform permutation tests. In this approach, branch labels are permuted across the tree, and the analysis is re-run multiple times. This generates an empirical null distribution of LRT statistics, which can then be used to calculate more accurate p-values.

4.  **False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control:** To address the multiple testing problem inherent in site-wise analyses, Contrast-FEL applies a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction (e.g., Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) to the p-values. This helps to control the proportion of false positives among the significant sites.

5.  **Interpretation of ω Ratios:**

    *   **ω < 1 (Purifying Selection):** Nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious and are removed by selection.
    *   **ω = 1 (Neutral Evolution):** Nonsynonymous mutations are neither advantageous nor deleterious.
    *   **ω > 1 (Positive Selection):** Nonsynonymous mutations are advantageous and are favored by selection.

By comparing the site-specific ω ratios among different branch sets, Contrast-FEL can pinpoint sites that have undergone adaptive evolution (positive selection) or strong functional constraint (purifying selection) in specific lineages, providing insights into the evolutionary history and functional divergence of genes.
