    Strelka2 is a fast and accurate small variant caller optimized
    for analysis of germline variation in small cohorts and somatic
    variation in tumor/normal sample pairs. The germline caller employs an
    efficient tiered haplotype model to improve accuracy and provide read-backed
    phasing, adaptively selecting between assembly and a faster alignment-based
    haplotyping approach at each variant locus. The germline caller also analyzes
    input sequencing data using a mixture-model indel error estimation method to
    improve robustness to indel noise. The somatic calling model improves on the
    original Strelka method for liquid and late-stage tumor analysis by accounting
    for possible tumor cell contamination in the normal sample. A final empirical
    variant re-scoring step using random forest models trained on various call
    quality features has been added to both callers to further improve precision.
