  Kissplice, DiscoSNP and TakeABreak perform de novo variant identification and quantification. For these tools the general approach consists in 1) defining a model for the seeked elements; 2) detecting in one or several NGS datasets those elements that fit the model; 3) outputting those together with a score and their genomic neighborhood.
  Mapsembler focuses on sequences of interest within a micro targeted assembly, LorDec uses short reads for correcting third generation long reads, and finally Commet is dedicated to the comparison of numerous metagenomic read sets.
