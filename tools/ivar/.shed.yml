long_description: |
  iVar is a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for
  viral amplicon-based sequencing. Additional tools for metagenomic sequencing
  are actively being incorporated into iVar. While each of these functions can
  be accomplished using existing tools, iVar contains an intersection of
  functionality from multiple tools that are required to call iSNVs and
  consensus sequences from viral sequencing data across multiple replicates. We
  implemented the following functions in iVar: (1) trimming of primers and
  low-quality bases, (2) consensus calling, (3) variant calling - both iSNVs and
  insertions/deletions, and (4) identifying mismatches to primer sequences and
  excluding the corresponding reads from alignment files.
