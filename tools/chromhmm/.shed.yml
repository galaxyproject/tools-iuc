long_description: |
  ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states. ChromHMM
  can integrate multiple chromatin datasets such as ChIP-seq data of various histone
  modifications to discover de novo the major re-occuring combinatorial and spatial
  patterns of marks. ChromHMM is based on a multivariate Hidden Markov Model that
  explicitly models the presence or absence of each chromatin mark. The resulting
  model can then be used to systematically annotate a genome in one or more cell
  types. By automatically computing state enrichments for large-scale functional
  and annotation datasets ChromHMM facilitates the biological characterization of
  each state. ChromHMM also produces files with genome-wide maps of chromatin state
  annotations that can be directly visualized in a genome browser.
