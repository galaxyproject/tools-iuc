  description: ChromHMM - Chromatin state discovery and characterization
  long_description: |
    ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states. ChromHMM
    can integrate multiple chromatin datasets such as ChIP-seq data of various histone
    modifications to discover de novo the major re-occuring combinatorial and spatial
    patterns of marks. ChromHMM is based on a multivariate Hidden Markov Model that
    explicitly models the presence or absence of each chromatin mark. The resulting
    model can then be used to systematically annotate a genome in one or more cell
    types. By automatically computing state enrichments for large-scale functional
    and annotation datasets ChromHMM facilitates the biological characterization of
    each state. ChromHMM also produces files with genome-wide maps of chromatin state
    annotations that can be directly visualized in a genome browser.
