Hi,

a couple of more questions/remarks. Again from a programmers point of you, because I never used chromhmm for an analysis.

BinarizeBed/BinarizeBam

The wrapper will create a cellmarkfiletable on the fly (because of Galaxys internal file handling). The example in the manual shows one control file per cell type/identifier (e.g. cell1_control.bed, cell2_control.bed). Is it possbible/allowed to use multiple control files for each group (e.g. cell1_mark1.control, cell1_mark2.control, ...). That's important to know, because I have to rename the input files. At the moment the second variant is implemented.

Do you have a test dataset for this - including contro files - so I can test the wrapper?

Manual: Typo in [-paired|[-center]. May I propose to write these commands ans [-center|-n|-paired|-peaks] in BinarizeBam/Be?
