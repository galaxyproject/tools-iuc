description: Merge long-read and hybrid assemblies to increase contiguity
long_description: |
    The program uses complementary information from genomes assembled with long reads in 
    order to improve contiguity, and works with assemblies derived from both Pacific 
    Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore. Quickmerge will even work with hybrid assemblies 
    made by combining long reads and Illumina short reads.
