**What it does**

cd-hit-lap is program for extracting pairs of overlapping reads by clustering based on tail-head overlaps (with perfect matching). The basic clustering strategy is the same as that in standard CD-HIT programs. In this program, each read is clustered as either a "representative" or a "redundant" read. For each "redundant" read, it must have a prefix that is identical a suffix of its representative read.

**Input**

cd-hit-lap requires a FASTQ or FASTA file as input.

**Output**

The output format of this program is the same as the standard CD-HIT. In the .clstr file, the alignment positions indicate how the reads are overlapped. For example, 

  >Cluster 0
  0   75nt, >1_lane2_624... *
  1   75nt, >1_lane2_7169... at 1:65:11:75/+/100.00%
  2   75nt, >1_lane2_36713... at 69:1:1:69/-/100.00%
  3   75nt, >1_lane2_141482... at 1:56:20:75/+/100.00%

The cluster member #0 in cluster #0 is the representative of the cluster, and it overlaps with each of the other members in the cluster. For cluster member #1, "1:65:11:75/+" tells that the first 65 bases of member #1 overlaps with the last 65 bases of member #0; "69:1:1:69/-" indicates that the last 69 bases of member #2 overlaps with the first 69 bases of member #0.
