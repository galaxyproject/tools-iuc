description: A windowed adaptive trimming tool for FASTQ files using quality
long_description: |
  Sickle is a tool that uses sliding windows along with quality and length
  thresholds to determine when quality is sufficiently low to trim the 3'-end
  of reads and also determines when the quality is sufficiently high enough to
  trim the 5'-end of reads. It will also discard reads based upon the length
  threshold. It takes the quality values and slides a window across them whose
  length is 0.1 times the length of the read. If this length is less than 1,
  then the window is set to be equal to the length of the read. Otherwise, the
  window slides along the quality values until the average quality in the window
  rises above the threshold, at which point the algorithm determines where
  within the window the rise occurs and cuts the read and quality there for the
  5'-end cut. Then when the average quality in the window drops below the
  threshold, the algorithm determines where in the window the drop occurs and
  cuts both the read and quality strings there for the 3'-end cut. However, if
  the length of the remaining sequence is less than the minimum length
  threshold, then the read is discarded entirely (or replaced with an "N"
  record). 5'-end trimming can be disabled.
