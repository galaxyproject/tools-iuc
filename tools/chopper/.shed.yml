    Chopper is a Rust implementation of NanoFilt & NanoLyse, both originally written in Python. 
    This tool, intended for long read sequencing such as PacBio or ONT, filters and trims a fastq
    file.  Filtering can be done on metrics like average read quality and minimal or maximal read 
    length, and applying a headcrop (start of read) and tailcrop (end of read) while printing the 
    reads passing the filter.    
    It is part of the NanoPack2 tool suite for visualizing and processing long read sequencing data.
