description: Detect gene fusions from RNA-Seq data.
long_description: |
   Arriba is a command-line tool for the detection of gene fusions from RNA-Seq data. It was developed for the use in a clinical research setting. Therefore, short runtimes and high sensitivity were important design criteria. It is based on the ultrafast STAR aligner and the post-alignment runtime is typically just ~2 minutes. In contrast to many other fusion detection tools which build on STAR, Arriba does not require to reduce the alignIntronMax parameter of STAR to detect fusions arising from focal deletions. Apart from gene fusions, Arriba can detect other structural rearrangements with potential clinical relevance, such as viral integration sites, internal tandem duplications, whole exon duplications, truncations of genes (i.e., breakpoints in introns and intergenic regions).
