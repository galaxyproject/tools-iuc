description: Arriba detects fusion genes in RNA-Seq data after running RNA-STAR
long_description: |
    Arriba detects gene fusions from STAR aligned RNA-Seq data. 
    It was developed for the use in a clinical research setting. 
    Therefore, short runtimes and high sensitivity were important design criteria. 

    Apart from gene fusions, Arriba can detect other structural rearrangements
    with potential clinical relevance, such as viral integration sites,
    internal tandem duplications, whole exon duplications,
    truncations of genes (i.e., breakpoints in introns and intergenic regions).
