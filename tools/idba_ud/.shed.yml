long_description: |
    IDBA is a iterative De Bruijn Graph De Novo Assembler for Short Reads Sequencing data. The variants IDBA_UD, IDBA_TRAN, and IDBA_HYBRID allow to assemble sequencing data with Highly Uneven Sequencing Depth, transcriptome data, and to assemble with an available reference genome, respectively.
