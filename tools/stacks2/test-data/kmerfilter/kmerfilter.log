Using a kmer size of 16
Filtering out reads by identifying rare kmers: On.
  A kmer is considered rare when its coverage is at 15% or below the median kmer coverage for the read.
  A read is dropped when it contains 13 or more rare kmers in a row.
Filtering out reads by identifying abundant kmers: On.
  Kmer is considered abundant when it occurs 20000 or more times.
  A read is dropped when it contains 80% or more abundant kmers.
Normalizing read depth: Off.
