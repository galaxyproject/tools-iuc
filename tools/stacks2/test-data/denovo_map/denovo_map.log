  0 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (0.0%);
  For the remaining 3 loci (100.0%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 204.3 bp;
  0 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (0.0%)
    Mean overlap: -nanbp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: -nan;
  Out of 252 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 84.0 reads per locus),
    252 were successfuly aligned (100.0%);
  Mean insert length was -nan, stdev: nan (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).
