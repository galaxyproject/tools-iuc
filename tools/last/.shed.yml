    LAST finds similar regions between sequences.
    The main technical innovation is that LAST finds initial matches based on their multiplicity, instead of using a fixed length (e.g. BLAST uses 11-mers). To find these variable-length matches, it uses a suffix array (inspired by Vmatch). To achieve high sensitivity, it uses a spaced suffix array (or subset suffix array), analogous to spaced seeds (or subset seeds).
    LAST can:
        - Handle big sequence data, e.g:
            - Compare two vertebrate genomes.
            - Align billions of DNA reads to a genome.
        - Indicate the reliability of each aligned column.
        - Use sequence quality data properly.
        - Compare DNA to proteins, with frameshifts.
        - Compare PSSMs to sequences.
        - Calculate the likelihood of chance similarities between random sequences.
        - Do split and spliced alignment.
        - Train alignment parameters for unusual kinds of sequence (e.g. nanopore).
