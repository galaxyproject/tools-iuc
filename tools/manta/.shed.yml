description: Structural variant and indel caller for mapped sequencing data
long_description: Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads. 
                  It is optimized for analysis of germline variation in small sets of individuals and somatic 
                  variation in tumor/normal sample pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and scores large-scale SVs, 
                  medium-sized indels and large insertions within a single efficient workflow..
