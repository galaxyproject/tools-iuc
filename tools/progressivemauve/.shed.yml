description: Mauve/ProgressiveMauve Multiple Sequence Aligner
long_description: |
  Mauve is a system for constructing multiple genome alignments in the presence
  of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement and inversion.
  Multiple genome alignments provide a basis for research into comparative
  genomics and the study of genome-wide evolutionary dynamics.

  Mauve has been developed with the idea that a multiple genome aligner should
  require only modest computational resources. It employs algorithmic
  techniques that scale well in the lengths of sequences being aligned. For
  example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under a minute, while
  a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in a few hours.
  However, the current algorithm’s compute time (progressiveMauve) scales
  cubically in the number of genomes to align, making it unsuitable for
  datasets containing more than 50-100 bacterial genomes.
