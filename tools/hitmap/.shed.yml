  Hitmap uses peptide mass fingerprint analysis and a dual scoring system to computationally assign peptide and protein annotations to high mass resolution MALDI-MSI datasets and generate customisable spatial distribution maps. 
  
  Note: consumes large amounts of memory during runtime. Run on a node with at least 64Gb memory.
