description: samblaster marks duplicates and can output split and discordant alignments from SAM/BAM files
long_description: |
    samblaster is a fast and flexible program for marking duplicates in read-id
    grouped paired-end SAM files. It can also optionally output discordant
    read pairs and/or split read mappings to separate SAM files, and/or
    unmapped/clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file. When marking duplicates,
    samblaster will require approximately 20MB of memory per 1M read pairs.
