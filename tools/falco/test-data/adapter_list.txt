# This file contains a set of sequence fragments which will be explicitly
# searched against your library.  The reporting will be similar to the 
# Kmer plot, except that every sequence in this list will be shown so 
# you can use this to judge the level of adapter read-through even if those
# adapter sequences aren't picked out by the Kmer module.
#
# Since every sequence here will be analysed and the results plotted it 
# doesn't make any sense to include duplicate sequences, or to add too
# many sequences since your plot will end up a mess.
#
# You can add more sequences to the file by putting one line per entry
# and specifying a name[tab]sequence.  If the contaminant you add is 
# likely to be of use to others please consider sending it to the FastQ
# authors, either via a bug report at www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/bugzilla/
# or by directly emailing simon.andrews@babraham.ac.uk so other users of
# the program can benefit.
#
# For the time being it's going to be easier to interpret this plot if all
# of the sequences provided are the same length, so we've gone with 12bp
# fragments for now.
