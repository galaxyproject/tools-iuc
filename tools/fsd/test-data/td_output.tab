Chimera Analysis:
The tags are splitted into two halves (part a and b) for which the Tag distances (TD) are calculated seperately.
The tag distance of the first half (part a) is calculated by comparing part a of the tag in the sample against all a parts in the dataset and by selecting the minimum value (TD a.min).
In the next step, we select those tags that showed the minimum TD and estimate the TD for the second half (part b) of the tag by comparing part b against the previously selected subset.
The maximum value represents then TD b.max. Finally, these process is repeated but starting with part b instead and TD b.min and TD a.max are calculated.
Next, the absolute differences between TD a.min & TD b.max and TD b.min & TD a.max are estimated (delta HD).
These are then divided by the sum of both parts (TD a.min + TD b.max or TD b.min + TD a.max, respectively) which give the relative differences between the partial HDs (rel. delta HD).
For simplicity, we used the maximum value of the relative differences and the respective delta HD.
Note that when only tags that can form a DCS are included in the analysis, the family sizes for both directions (ab and ba) of the strand will be included in the plots.

All tags are filtered and only those tags where one half is identical (TD=0) and therefore, have a relative delta TD of 1, are kept.
These tags are considered as chimeras.
