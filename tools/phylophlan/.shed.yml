long_description: PhyloPhlAn is a comprehensive and scalable pipeline for phylogenetic profiling of microbial genomes and metagenomes. It supports accurate species- and strain-level classification, including for metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), and can reconstruct large-scale phylogenies using clade-specific informative markers.
