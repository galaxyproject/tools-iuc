In the plot, the family sizes of ab and ba strands and of both duplex tags were used.
Whereas the total numbers indicate only the single count of the formed duplex tags.
total nr. of tags (unique, FS>=1),16
DCS (before SSCS building, FS>=1),16
total nr. of tags (unique, FS>=3),16
DCS (before SSCS building, FS>=3),16
after DCS building,25
after trimming,17
after alignment to reference,16
