**What it does**
        
    This tool will create a distribution of family sizes of various datasets obtained from different steps of the Du Novo pipeline. 
               
**Input**
        
    **Dataset 1:** This tools expects a tabular file with the tags of all families, their sizes and information about forward (ab) and reverse (ba) strands. 
    
    +-----+----------------------------+----+
    | 1   | AAAAAAAAAAAATGTTGGAATCTT   | ba |
    +-----+----------------------------+----+
    | 10  | AAAAAAAAAAAGGCGGTCCACCCC   | ab |
    +-----+----------------------------+----+
    | 28  | AAAAAAAAAAATGGTATGGACCGA   | ab |
    +-----+----------------------------+----+
    
    
    
    **Dataset 2:** A fasta file with all tags and their family sizes of both strands (forward and reverse) in the header and the read itself in the next line is required. This input file can be obtained by the tool "Du Novo: make consensus reads". 
    
    
    **Dataset 3 (optional):** In addition, the fasta file with all tags, which were not filtered out after trimming, can be given. This file can be obtained by the tool "Sequence Content Trimmer".
    For both input files, only one file from both tools are necessary (these tools give for both forward and reverse strands an output file), since both files have the same tags and family sizes, but different reads, which are not required in this tool.

    | CNCNGGCCCCCCGCTCCGTGCACAGACGNNGCNACTGACAA |
    +-------------------------------------------+
    
    
    
	
    **Dataset 4 (optional):** Finally, a TXT file with the regions and all tags that were aligned to the reference genome can be given as input. This file can be obtained by the tool "Duplex Sequencing Analysis: range2tag".

    +-----------+------------------------------+

    +-----------+------------------------------+
    | 656_1143  | GGGGCAGCCATATTGGCAATTATCAT   |
    +-----------+------------------------------+
   
**Output**
        
    The output is a PDF file with the plot and a tabular file with the data of the plot.
