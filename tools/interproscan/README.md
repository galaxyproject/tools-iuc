# InterProScan

## Licensed software/data

The standard install of InterProScan does not include the following components, because their license does not allow redistribution:

- SignalP
- TMHMM
- Phobius
- SMART data (THRESHOLD file)

As a Galaxy instance admin, you can install those manually if needed, as long as you (and the Galaxy users) respect the respective licenses.
