long_description: QUAST evaluates genome assemblies by computing various metrics, including 
    - N50, length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least 50% of assembly length,
    - NG50, where length of the reference genome is being covered,
    - NA50 and NGA50, where aligned blocks instead of contigs are taken,
    - misassemblies, misassembled and unaligned contigs or contigs bases,
    - genes and operons covered.
