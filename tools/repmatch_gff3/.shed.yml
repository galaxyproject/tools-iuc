  Contains a tool that requires 2 or more input datasets and discovers peak-pair midpoints the first dataset.
  It then looks up all peak-pair midpoints in a second dataset that are within a user-specified distance from
  the peak-pair midpoint coordinate in the first dataset.  When encountering multiple candidates to match, it
  looks for a user-specified resolution method so that there is at most only a one-to-one match across the two
  datasets.
