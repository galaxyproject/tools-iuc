description: Assembling the cause of phenotypes and genotypes from NGS data
long_description: |
  You have a set of samples where you have a known phenotype, and a set of controls.
  PlasmidTron lets you assemble the differences between the two so that you can gain a better understanding of the phenotype and the other sequences around it (the rest of the plasmid).
  For example, often researchers will just look for an anti-microbial resistance gene, and look no further, because its still a difficult problem.
  PlasmidTron can let you see the sequence around your gene, giving you greater biological insights into the mechanisms of the resistance.
  Whilst its primary purpose is to pull out plasmids, phage can also be recovered.
