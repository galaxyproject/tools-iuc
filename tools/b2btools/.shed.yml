    This software suite provides structural predictions for protein sequences made by Bio2Byte group.
    About Bio2Byte: We investigate how the dynamics, conformational states, and available experimental data of proteins relate to their amino acid sequence.
    Underlying physical and chemical principles are computationally unraveled through data integration, analysis, and machine learning, so connecting them
    to biological events and improving our understanding of the way proteins work.
