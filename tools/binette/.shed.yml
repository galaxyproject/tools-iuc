long_description: |
  Binette is a fast and accurate binning refinement tool to constructs high quality MAGs
  from the output of multiple binning tools with the help of CheckM2.
  Binette is inspired from the metaWRAP bin-refinement tool but it effectively solves all the
  problems from that very tool.
