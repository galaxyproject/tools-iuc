  Contains a tool that separately identifies peaks on the forward "+” (W) and reverse “-” (C) strand.  The centroid
  of read (tag) clusters represent a consensus nuclease stop point.  To calculate the centroid or peak, clusters of
  tags are smoothed via a Gaussian distribution and the nearest coordinate at the peak is recorded.  No other peak
  on the same strand is allowed to be called within a ± bp distance of the peak as defined by the exclusion zone. The
  start and end of the exclusion zone is reported in the output dataset.
