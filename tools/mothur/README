Galaxy wrappers for the Mothur metagenomics tools (http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Main_Page)

The Mothur Tool Suite repository:
	- Provides Mothur wrappers for the Mothur tools
	- Downloads and builds Mothur and all its dependencies on the Linux or Mac operating system

Installing Tools via the API:
This is a rather large tool suite, if you are having problems installing via the toolshed, try using the API instead
    - Install ephemeris: pip install ephemeris -U
    - Use ephemeris to install tools: shed_install -a <your admin API key> -t tools.yaml
    - (You can find a tools.yaml you can use in this repo as well)

Installing reference data:
    - There is a Galaxy datamanager available for Mothur. If you cannot find the reference files, ask your admin to install them. They can also be found
      in the mothur website. For reference, there are available:
