Galaxy wrappers for the Mothur metagenomics tools (http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Main_Page)

The Mothur Tool Suite repository:
	- Provides Mothur wrappers for the Mothur tools
	- Downloads and builds Mothur and all its dependencies on the Linux or Mac operating system

Installing Tools via the API:
This is a rather large tool suite, if you are having problems installing via the toolshed, try using the API instead
    - Install ephemeris: pip install ephemeris -U
    - Use ephemeris to install tools: shed_install -a <your admin API key> -t tools.yaml
    - (You can find a tools.yaml you can use in this repo as well)

Installing reference data:
    - There is a Galaxy datamanager available for Mothur, but the most recent reference files may not be included yet.
