    The mothur project seeks to offers a single piece of open-source, expandable software to fill the bioinformatics needs of the microbial ecology community.
    We have incorporated the functionality of dotur, sons, treeclimber, s-libshuff, unifrac, and much more.
    In addition to improving the flexibility of these algorithms, we have added a number of other features including calculators and visualization tools.
