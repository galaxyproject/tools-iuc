description: Index and query k-mers from sequencing samples using Bloom filters
long_description: |
  kmindex is a tool for building k-mer indices from sequencing samples and querying them efficiently
  using Bloom filter data structures. It enables researchers to compute the percentage of shared k-mers
  between queries and indexed samples in large genomic databases. Built on top of kmtricks, kmindex
  supports both presence/absence indexing (Bloom filters) and abundance indexing (Counting Bloom filters),
  and can handle terabyte-scale datasets with real-time query capabilities. The tool implements the
  Findere algorithm to reduce false positives by querying (s+z)-mers instead of standard k-mers.
