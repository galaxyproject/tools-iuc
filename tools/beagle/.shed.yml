long_description: |
   Beagle is a program for phasing and imputing missing genotypes. Sporadic missing
   genotypes are imputed during phasing. If a reference panel of phased genotypes is specified
   with the ref argument, ungenotyped markers that are present in the reference panel can also
   be imputed.
