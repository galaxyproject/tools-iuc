This release includes a new database file to correspond with AMRFinderPlus
version 3.1 that includes information for blacklisting of a few "plus" proteins
common in some organisms that are interesting when found in others.  This

typos; removal of a redundant point mutation reference sequence; and the
addition, reoorganization, and renaming of some "plus" genes.

Changes included in 2019-07-10.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

New alleles and sequences were added, a few product names were made more
specific as more phenotype information became available. Cleanup of the
database caused some families and HMMs not used by AMRFinderPlus to be removed.

This the first alpha release of the AMRFinderPlus database. For this and all
following releases there is a distinction between "core" proteins which
correspond to the genes that would previously have been reported by AMRFinder
and "plus" proteins that are new genes and classes of genes. The "core"
designation is given to proteins where we believe their presence is likely to
have an important effect on antimicrobial resistance.

* Screen for select point mutations for antibiotic resistance from Salmonella,
    E. coli, and Campylobacter
    * Protein mutations in: 50S_L22 protein, acrB, acrR, basR, cmeR, cyaA,
      fabG, fabI, folP, gyrA, gyrB, lon, marR, murA, nfsA, ompF, parC, parE,
      pmrA, pmrB, ptsI, ramR, rpoB, rpsL, soxR, soxS, tufA, uhpA, uhpT
    * Nucleotide mutations in 16S and 23S rRNA
    * Included point mutations are listed in the reference gene database
      (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates#/refgene/)
* New "Plus" genes
    * virulence factors
    * biocide resistance
    * metal resistance
    * heat resistance
    * acid resistance
* Combined and integrated results from nucleotide and protein searches

File formats have changed significantly. See https://github.com/evolarjun/amr/wiki
for details.

Since release 2019-04-29.1 only one change has been made to the core AMR
proteins. Qac's are now categorized under Type STRESS and Subtype BIOCIDE.

Summary: In addition to the usual addition of 134 new genes and alleles
community feedback led to the renaming of a few dfr genes.  The family
heirarchy file (fam.tab) was cleaned up by removing a number of superfluous
entries.

Two incorrectly assigned proteins were accidentally released. They are not
AMR proteins and should not have been released. This release simply removes
them and is otherwise unchanged.

Due to a communication error three blaOXA alleles in the AMR database have
been reassigned. Alleles published by Tian, et al. (PMID:30247543) have
replaced them.

Updates in 2018-07-07.1
- Fix in amr_report.cpp to remove extra field from AMRFinder output

Updates in 2018-06-27.1
- Summary:
    - Protein sequences
        - Removed 1 protein sequence
        - Added 290 protein sequences
        - Changed the names of 2 proteins
    - Gene families
        - cfr was reorganized
    - HMM library
        - 58 HMMs not in the AMR family hierarchy were removed. They were not
          used for AMR gene identification so this should have no effect on
          AMRFinder output.
        - The polymyxin_MCR3 HMM was updated
