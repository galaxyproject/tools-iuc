description: NCBI Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Finder Plus
long_description: >
  This software and the accompanying database are designed to find acquired
  antimicrobial resistance genes in bacterial protein or assembled nucleotide
  sequences as well as known point mutations for several taxa. With
  AMRFinderPlus we have added select members of additional classes of genes such
  as virulence factors, biocide, heat, acid, and metal resistance genes.
