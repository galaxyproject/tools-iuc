description: Fast distance matrix calculations on fasta and cgmlst inputs
long_description: |
  Distle calculates distance matrices from multiple sequence alignments in fasta
  format or from multi-locus allelic profiles like the ones produced by the
  AlleleCall module of chewBBACA. Besides numeric allele codes, hashed alleles
  are also supported. The tool provides several optimization and options for
  dealing with large input data efficiently.
