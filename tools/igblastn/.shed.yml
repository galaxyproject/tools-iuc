description: Analysis of immunoglobulin variable domain sequences
long_description: IgBLAST was developed at NCBI to facilitate analysis of immunoglobulin variable domain sequences (IgBLAST has recently been extended to perform analysis for T cell receptor (TR) sequences). It uses BLAST search algorithm. Igblastn also reports the germline V, D and J gene matches to the query sequence. Annotates the immunoglobulin domains (FR1 through FR4). Reveals the V(D)J junction details such as nucleotide homology between the ends of V(D)J segments and N nucleotide insertions. Indicates the whether the rearrangement is in-frame or out-of-frame. D and J gene reporting is only for nucleotide sequence search. A continuous match of at least 5 and 7 bases between a query and a germline gene is required for identification of D and J genes, respectively.
