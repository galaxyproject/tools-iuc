description: Measure allele-specific telomere length from long-read sequencing data
long_description: |
  Telogator measures allele-specific telomere length (ATL) and characterizes telomere
  variant repeat (TVR) sequences from PacBio HiFi and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing
  data. The tool identifies individual telomere alleles through TVR characterization,
  providing chromosome-level resolution of telomere lengths. Supports multiple input
  formats (FASTA, FASTQ, BAM, CRAM) and includes built-in T2T human reference with
  support for custom references.
