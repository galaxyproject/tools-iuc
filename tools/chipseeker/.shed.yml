description: A tool for ChIP peak annotation and visualization
long_description: This wrapper implements the ChIPseeker functions to retrieve the nearest genes around peaks and annotate with genomic region information (Promoter, 5’ UTR, 3’ UTR, Exon, Intron, Downstream, Intergenic, distance to nearest TSS). It also generates some visualisations of the results. Currently supports human and mouse (hg38, hg19, mm10).
