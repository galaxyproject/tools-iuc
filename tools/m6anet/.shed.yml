description: "m6anet to detect m6A RNA modifications from nanopore data"
long_description: |
    m6anet leverages a Multiple Instance Learning framework to detect m6a modifications from Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing data.
    To detect m6A modifications from your direct RNA sequencing sample, provide a tabular output of nanopolish-eventalign tool here.
    Behind the scenes, this m6anet tool first pre-processes the segmented raw signal file using ‘m6anet dataprep’ and then executes 'm6anet inference'
    function on its output to assign a probability that a modified read or site exists, which are returned as two separate tabulars from the tool to the history.
