description: Predictor of signal peptides in proteins based on deep learning
long_description: DeepSig is a novel approach to predict signal peptides in proteins based on 
                  deep learning and sequence labelling methods. The proposed approach was 
                  evaluated and compared with other available predictors, including the top-performing SignalP.
