  Remove terminal stop codons from coding sequences in a FASTA file.
  This tool is designed as a preprocessing step for downstream analysis tools
  like cawlign and HyPhy that do not permit stop codons in their input sequences.
  It uses NCBI genetic codes to correctly identify stop codons for different organisms.
