long_description: |
  FastANI is developed for fast alignment-free computation of whole-genome
  Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). ANI is defined as mean nucleotide identity
  of orthologous gene pairs shared between two microbial genomes. FastANI
  supports pairwise comparison of both complete and draft genome assemblies.
