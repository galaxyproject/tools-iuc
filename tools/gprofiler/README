Galaxy wrapper for gprofiler2
=========================

g:Profiler is a widely used toolset for finding biological categories enriched in gene lists, conversions between gene identifiers and mappings to their orthologs. Mission of g:Profiler is to provide a reliable service based on up to date high quality data in a convenient manner across many evidence types, identifier spaces and organisms. g:Profiler relies on Ensembl as a primary data source and follows their quarterly release cycle while updating the other data sources simultaneously. g:Profiler provides modern responsive interactive web interface, standardised API, an R package gprofiler2 and libraries. The results are delivered through interactive and configurable interface. Results can be downloaded as publication ready visualisations or delimited text files. g:Profiler supports close to 500 species and strains, including vertebrates, plants, fungi, insects and parasites. By supporting user uploaded custom GMT files, g:Profiler is capable of analysing data from any organism. All past releases are maintained for reproducibility and transparency. g:Profiler is freely available for all users at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler.
