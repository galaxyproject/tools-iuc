long_description: |
  g:Profiler is a toolset for finding biological categories enriched in gene lists (g:GOSt), conversions between
  gene identifiers (g:Convert), mappings to their orthologs (g:Orth) and mappings SNP rs-codes to gene names,
  chromosomal coordinates and variant effects (g:SNPense).
