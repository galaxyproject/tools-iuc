long_description: |
  COMEBin, a binning method based on contrastive multi-view representation learning.
  COMEBin utilizes data augmentation to generate multiple fragments (views) of each 
  contig and obtains high-quality embeddings of heterogeneous features 
  (sequence coverage and k-mer distribution) through contrastive learning.
