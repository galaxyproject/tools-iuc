description: Lift gene annotations between genome assemblies using Liftoff
long_description: |
  Liftoff maps annotations in GFF or GTF from a reference genome to a target genome
  by aligning genes with minimap2 and rebuilding gene models that maximize identity
  while preserving exon/transcript structure.
