    PlasFlow - Prediction of plasmid sequences in metagenomic contigs.
long_description: |
    PlasFlow is a set of scripts used for prediction of plasmid sequences in metagenomic contigs.
    It relies on the neural network models trained on full genome and plasmid sequences and is able
    to differentiate between plasmids and chromosomes with accuracy reaching 96%. It outperforms
    other available solutions for plasmids recovery from metagenomes and incorporates the thresholding
    which allows for exclusion of incertain predictions.
