description: Faster de novo assembly pipeline based around Spades
long_description: |
  The SPAdes genome assembler has become the de facto standard de novo genome assembler
  for Illumina whole genome sequencing data of bacteria and other small microbes.
  SPAdes was a major improvement over previous assemblers like Velvet,
  but it can be very slow to run and does not handle overlapping paired-end reads well.

  Shovill is a pipeline which uses SPAdes at its core, but alters the steps before and after
  the primary assembly step to get near-identical results in far less time.
