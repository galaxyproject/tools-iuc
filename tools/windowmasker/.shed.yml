  WindowMasker identifies repetitive sequences and low complexity regions within a
  genome assembly. WindowMasker works in two stages. In stage 1, mkcount produces a
  unit counts file for a genome assembly. In stage 2, ustat uses the unit counts file
  to mask repeats in the genome assembly. See Morgulis A, 2006 (PMID: 16287941) for details.
