long_description: |
   AmpliCan is an analysis tool for genome editing that unites 
   highly precise quantification and visualization of genuine 
   genome editing events. ampliCan features nuclease-optimized 
   alignments, filtering of experimental artifacts, event-specific 
   normalization, and off-target read detection and quantifies 
   insertions, deletions, HDR repair, as well as targeted base editing.
