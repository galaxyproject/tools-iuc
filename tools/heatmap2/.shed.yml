long_description: |
  This tool uses the heatmap.2 function from the R gplots package to create a heatmap. A heatmap is a false color image with a dendrogram added to the left side and/or to the top. Typically, reordering of the rows and columns according to some set of values (row or column means) within the restrictions imposed by the dendrogram is carried out.
