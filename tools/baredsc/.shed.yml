description: baredSC is a tool that uses a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain to estimate a confidence interval on the probability density function (PDF) of expression of one or two genes from single-cell RNA-seq data.

long_description: baredSC for Bayesian Approach to Retreive Expression Distribution of Single Cel uses the raw counts and the total number of UMI for each cell. The PDF is approximated by a number of 1d or 2d gaussians provided by the user. The likelihood is estimated using the asumption that the raw counts follow a Poisson distribution of parameter equal to the proportion of mRNA for the gene in the cell multiplied by the total number of UMI identified in this cell.
