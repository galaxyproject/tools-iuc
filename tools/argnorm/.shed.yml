  argNorm is a tool to normalize antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by mapping them to the antibiotic resistance ontology (ARO) created by the CARD database. The tool takes as input a list of ARGs and returns the normalized ARGs, which are the ARO identifiers.
  argNorm also enhances antibiotic resistance gene annotations by providing drug categorization of the drugs that antibiotic resistance genes confer resistance to.
