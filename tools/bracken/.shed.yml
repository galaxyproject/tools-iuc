description: Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN
long_description: |
  Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) is a highly accurate
  statistical method that computes the abundance of species in DNA sequences from a
  metagenomics sample.
  Braken uses the taxonomy labels assigned by Kraken, a highly accurate metagenomics
  classification algorithm, to estimate the number of reads originating from each species
  present in a sample.
  Kraken classifies reads to the best matching location in the taxonomic tree, but does
  not estimate abundances of species.
  We use the Kraken database itself to derive probabilities that describe how much
  sequence from each genome is identical to other genomes in the database, and combine
  this information with the assignments for a particular sample to estimate abundance
  at the species level, the genus level, or above.
  Combined with the Kraken classifier, Bracken produces accurate species- and genus-level
  abundance estimates even when a sample contains two or more near-identical species.
