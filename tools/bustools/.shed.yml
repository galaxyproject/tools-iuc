    BUS format is a file format for single-cell RNA-seq data designed to facilitate the development of modular workflows for data processing.
    It consists of a binary representation of barcode and UMI sequences from scRNA-seq reads, along with sets of equivalence classes obtained
    by pseudoalignment of reads to a reference transcriptome (hence the acronym Barcode, UMI, Set). BUS files are a convenient and useful
    checkpoint during single-cell RNA-seq processing. Bustools is a method of working with these files.
