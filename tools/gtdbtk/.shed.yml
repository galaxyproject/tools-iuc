long_description: |
  GTDB-Tk is a software tool kit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomes
  based on the Genome Database Taxonomy GTDB. It is designed to work with recent advances that allow hundreds or
  thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. It can also
  be applied to isolate and single-cell genomes.
