   abstract = "Command-line annotation software tools have continuously gained popularity compared to
   centralized online services due to the worldwide increase of sequenced bacterial genomes.
   However, results of existing command-line software pipelines heavily depend on taxon-specific
   databases or sufficiently well annotated reference genomes. Here, we introduce Bakta, a new command-line
   software tool for the robust, taxon-independent, thorough and, nonetheless, fast annotation of bacterial genomes.
   Bakta conducts a comprehensive annotation workflow including the detection of small proteins taking into account
   replicon metadata. The annotation of coding sequences is accelerated via an alignment-free sequence identification
   approach that in addition facilitates the precise assignment of public database cross-references.
   Annotation results are exported in GFF3 and International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)-compliant flat files,
   as well as comprehensive JSON files, facilitating automated downstream analysis.
   We compared Bakta to other rapid contemporary command-line annotation software tools in both targeted and taxonomically broad benchmarks
   including isolates and metagenomic-assembled genomes. We demonstrated that Bakta outperforms other tools in terms of functional annotations,
   the assignment of functional categories and database cross-references, whilst providing comparable wall-clock runtimes.
   Bakta is implemented in Python 3 and runs on MacOS and Linux systems.
   It is freely available under a GPLv3 license at https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta.
   An accompanying web version is available at https://bakta.computational.bio.",
