long_description: |
  Filter sequences using accelerated minimizer comparison with query sequence(s), 
  emitting either matching sequences (search mode), or sequences without matches (deplete mode). 
  Sequences match when they share enough distinct minimizers with the indexed query to exceed chosen 
  absolute and relative thresholds.
