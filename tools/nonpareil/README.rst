Nonpareil memory usage
======================

By default, this tool is configured to limit the memory consumption to 1024 Mib.

Ideally, this value should be larger than the sequences to analyze (discarding non-sequence elements like headers or quality). This is particularly important when running in multiple cores.
This value is approximated. Maximum value in this version: 4194303.
