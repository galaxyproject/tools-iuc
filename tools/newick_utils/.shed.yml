description: Perform operations on Newick trees
long_description: |
    The Newick Utilities are a set of tools for working with phylogenetic trees.
    They are not tools for making phylogenies. Rather, they are for processing existing ones,
    for example manipulating the tree or extracting information from it; displaying, rerooting,
    simplifying, extracting subtrees, printing branch lengths and distances, etc
