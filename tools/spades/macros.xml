SPAdes – St. Petersburg genome assembler – is an assembly toolkit containing various assembly pipelines.


    ]]></token>

    <token name="@HELP_INPUT@"><![CDATA[
The current version of SPAdes works with Illumina or IonTorrent reads and is capable of providing hybrid assemblies using PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and Sanger reads. You can also provide additional contigs that will be used as long reads.

SPAdes takes as input paired-end reads, mate-pairs and single (unpaired) reads in FASTA and FASTQ. For IonTorrent data SPAdes also supports unpaired reads in unmapped BAM format (like the one produced by Torrent Server). However, in order to run read error correction, reads should be in FASTQ or BAM format. Sanger, Oxford Nanopore and PacBio CLR reads can be provided in both formats since SPAdes does not run error correction for these types of data.

SPAdes can take as input several paired-end and mate-pair libraries simultaneously. Note, that SPAdes was initially designed for small genomes. It was tested on bacterial (both single-cell MDA and standard isolates), fungal and other small genomes. SPAdes is not intended for larger genomes (e.g. mammalian size genomes). For such purposes you can use it at your own risk.

You need at least one library of the following types:

- Illumina paired-end/high-quality mate-pairs/unpaired reads
- IonTorrent paired-end/high-quality mate-pairs/unpaired reads
- PacBio CCS reads

Illumina and IonTorrent libraries should not be assembled together. All other types of input data are compatible. SPAdes should not be used if only PacBio CLR, Oxford Nanopore, Sanger reads or additional contigs are available.

SPAdes supports mate-pair only assembly. However, we recommend to use only high-quality mate-pair libraries in this case (e.g. that do not have a paired-end part). We tested mate-pair only pipeline using Illumina Nextera mate-pairs. See more here.

Current version SPAdes also supports Lucigen NxSeq® Long Mate Pair libraries, which always have forward-reverse orientation.

Notes:

- It is strongly suggested to provide multiple paired-end and mate-pair libraries according to their insert size (from smallest to longest).
- It is not recommended to run SPAdes on PacBio reads with low coverage (less than 5).
- We suggest not to run SPAdes on PacBio reads for large genomes.

Read-pair libraries

By using command line interface, you can specify up to nine different paired-end libraries, up to nine mate-pair libraries and also up to nine high-quality mate-pair ones. If you wish to use more, you can use YAML data set file. We further refer to paired-end and mate-pair libraries simply as to read-pair libraries.

By default, SPAdes assumes that paired-end and high-quality mate-pair reads have forward-reverse (fr) orientation and usual mate-pairs have reverse-forward (rf) orientation. However, different orientations can be set for any library by using SPAdes options.

To distinguish reads in pairs we refer to them as left and right reads. For forward-reverse orientation, the forward reads correspond to the left reads and the reverse reads, to the right. Similarly, in reverse-forward orientation left and right reads correspond to reverse and forward reads, respectively, etc.

Each read-pair library can be stored in several files or several pairs of files. Paired reads can be organized in two different ways:

    In file pairs. In this case left and right reads are placed in different files and go in the same order in respective files.
    In interleaved files. In this case, the reads are interlaced, so that each right read goes after the corresponding paired left read.

For example, Illumina produces paired-end reads in two files: R1.fastq and R2.fastq. If you choose to store reads in file pairs make sure that for every read from R1.fastq the corresponding paired read from R2.fastq is placed in the respective paired file on the same line number. If you choose to use interleaved files, every read from R1.fastq should be followed by the corresponding paired read from R2.fastq.

If adapter and/or quality trimming software has been used prior to assembly, files with the orphan reads can be provided as "single read files" for the corresponding read-pair library.


If you have merged some of the reads from your paired-end (not mate-pair or high-quality mate-pair) library (using tools s.a. BBMerge or STORM), you should provide the file with resulting reads as a "merged read file" for the corresponding library.
Note that non-empty files with the remaining unmerged left/right reads (separate or interlaced) must be provided for the same library (for SPAdes to correctly detect the original read length).

In an unlikely case some of the reads from your mate-pair (or high-quality mate-pair) library are "merged", you should provide the resulting reads as a SEPARATE single-read library.
Unpaired (single-read) libraries

By using command line interface, you can specify up to nine different single-read libraries. To input more libraries, you can use YAML data set file.

Single librairies are assumed to have high quality and a reasonable coverage. For example, you can provide PacBio CCS reads as a single-read library.

Note, that you should not specify PacBio CLR, Sanger reads or additional contigs as single-read libraries, each of them has a separate option.

PacBio and Oxford Nanopore reads

SPAdes can take as an input an unlimited number of PacBio and Oxford Nanopore libraries.

PacBio CLR and Oxford Nanopore reads are used for hybrid assemblies (e.g. with Illumina or IonTorrent). There is no need to pre-correct this kind of data. SPAdes will use PacBio CLR and Oxford Nanopore reads for gap closure and repeat resolution.

For PacBio you just need to have filtered subreads in FASTQ/FASTA format. Provide these filtered subreads using --pacbio option. Oxford Nanopore reads are provided with --nanopore option.

PacBio CCS/Reads of Insert reads or pre-corrected (using third-party software) PacBio CLR / Oxford Nanopore reads can be simply provided as single reads to SPAdes.
Additional contigs

In case you have contigs of the same genome generated by other assembler(s) and you wish to merge them into SPAdes assembly, you can specify additional contigs using --trusted-contigs or --untrusted-contigs. First option is used when high quality contigs are available. These contigs will be used for graph construction, gap closure and repeat resolution. Second option is used for less reliable contigs that may have more errors or contigs of unknown quality. These contigs will be used only for gap closure and repeat resolution. The number of additional contigs is unlimited.

Note, that SPAdes does not perform assembly using genomes of closely-related species. Only contigs of the same genome should be specified.
