    SPAdes includes the following additional pipelines: metaSPAdes (a pipeline for 
    metagenomic data sets), plasmidSPAdes (a pipeline for extracting and assembling
    plasmids from WGS data sets), rnaSPAdes (a de novo transcriptome assembler from
    RNA-Seq data), and truSPAdes (a module for TruSeq barcode assembly).
