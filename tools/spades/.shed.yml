    description: Genome assembler for genomes of regular and single-cell projects.
    long_description: |
      SPAdes is a genome assembly algorithm which was designed for single cell and multi-cells bacterial data sets. Therefore, it might not be suitable for large genomes projects. SPAdes works with Ion Torrent, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore, and Illumina paired-end, mate-pairs and single reads.

      plasmidSPAdes is a pipeline for assembling plasmid data sets. Ihas the potential to massively increase the throughput of plasmid sequencing and to provide information about plasmids in thousands of sequenced bacterial genomes by re-assembling their genomes, identifying their plasmids and supplementing the corresponding GenBank entries with the plasmid annotations
