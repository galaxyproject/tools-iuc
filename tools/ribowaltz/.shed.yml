description: Calculation of optimal P-site offsets, diagnostic analysis and visual inspection of ribosome profiling data
homepage_url: https://github.com/LabTranslationalArchitectomics/riboWaltz
long_description: |
  Taking advantage of a two-step algorithm where offset information is passed through populations of reads with different length in order to maximize offset coherence, riboWaltz computes with high precision the P-site offset. riboWaltz also provides a variety of graphical representations, laying the foundations for further accurate RiboSeq analyses and improved interpretation of positional information.
