    RRMScorer is a software tool developed by the Bio2Byte group that predicts RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) scores for protein sequences based solely on sequence information. This tool allows researchers to evaluate the potential RNA-binding capabilities of proteins, aiding in the study of RNA-protein interactions without the need for experimental data.
    About Bio2Byte: We explore how protein dynamics, conformational states, and experimental data relate to their amino acid sequences through computational methods. Our approach integrates data analysis and machine learning to enhance understanding of protein functions and interactions.
