long_description: |
    ngsderive is a forensic analysis tool useful for backwards computing
    information from next-generation sequencing data. The strandedness
    subcommand infers whether RNA-seq data was generated using a
    Stranded-Forward, Stranded-Reverse, or Unstranded protocol by analyzing
    read alignments against a gene model.
