long_description: |
    MetaMDBG is a fast and low-memory assembler for long and accurate metagenomics 
    reads (e.g. PacBio HiFi, Nanopore r10.4). It is based on the minimizer de-Brujin graph (MDBG), 
    which have been reimplemetend specifically for metagenomics assembly. MetaMDBG combines an efficient 
    multi-k approach in minimizer-space for dealing with uneven species coverages, and a novel 
    abundance-based filtering method for simplifying strain complexity.
