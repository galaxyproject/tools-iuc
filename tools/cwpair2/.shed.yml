  Contains a tool that takes a list of called peaks on both strands and produces a list of matched pairs
  and a list of unmatched orphans.  Nuclease stops (peaks) are expected to be on both strands at a fixed
  distance in the 5â€™ direction from the site of crosslinking.  By pairing peaks within an empirically imposed
  distance, false positive peaks can be removed. It can also specify the point of crosslinking.
