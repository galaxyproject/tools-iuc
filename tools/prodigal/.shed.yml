description: A protein-coding gene prediction software tool for bacterial and archaeal genomes
long_description: | 
       Prodigal provides fast, accurate protein-coding gene predictions in GFF3, Genbank, or Sequin table format and runs smoothly on finished genomes, draft genomes, and metagenomes. 
       It's an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It does not need to be provided with any training data, and instead automatically learns the properties of the genome from the 
       sequence itself, including genetic code, RBS motif usage, start codon usage, and coding statistics.
