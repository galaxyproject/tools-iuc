description: AlphaGenome toolkit for variant effect prediction and regulatory genomics
long_description: |
  Galaxy wrappers for Google DeepMind's AlphaGenome genomic foundation model.
  AlphaGenome predicts regulatory variant effects across gene expression, splicing,
  chromatin accessibility, and 3D contact maps at single base-pair resolution.
  Includes tools for variant effect scoring, in-silico saturation mutagenesis,
  interval prediction, and sequence prediction.
