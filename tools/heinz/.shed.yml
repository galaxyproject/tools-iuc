description: An algorithm for identification of the optimal scoring subnetwork.
long_description: |
  An algorithm for identification of the optimal scoring subnetwork. This tool provides
  a workflow over the output (a bunch of p-values) of differential expression analysis
  (e.g., DESeq2) by fitting them into a distribution first, then transforming them into Heinz
  scores. Based on the scores, Heinz is able to pinpoint an optimal subnetwork from the background
  network made from such as KEGG and Reactome.
