description: "vcf2maf: Convert VCF into MAF"
long_description: |
    The tool vcf2maf can parse a wide range of VCF-like formats and convert these 
    into the Mutation Annotation Format (MAF). A central part of the conversion 
    process is the selection of a single effect per variant. While this is often 
    a subjective decision, vcf2maf offers a standardized way to achieve this by 
    optionally utilizing Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP).
