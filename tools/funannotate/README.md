# Funannotate

Funannotate can use GeneMark to predict gene, but due to licensing issues, we are not allowed to distribute GeneMark automatically.

If you want to use it, the Galaxy administrator needs to install it GeneMark following the instructions on https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate, and set the `GENEMARK_PATH` variable on the job destination.
