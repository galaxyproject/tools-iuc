long_description: |
  MAPseq is a set of fast and accurate sequence read classification tools designed to assign
  taxonomy and OTU classifications to ribosomal RNA sequences. This is done by using a reference
  set of full-length ribosomal RNA sequences for which known taxonomies are known, and for which a
  set of high quality OTU clusters has been previously generated. For each read, the best guess and
  correspoding confidence in the assignment is shown at each taxonomic and OTU level.
