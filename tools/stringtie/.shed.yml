  StringTie is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments
  into potential transcripts. It is primarily a genome-guided transcriptome assembler,
  although it can borrow algorithmic techniques from de novo genome assembly to help
  with transcript assembly. Its input can include not only the spliced read alignments
  used by reference-based assemblers, but also longer contigs that were assembled
  de novo from unambiguous, non-branching parts of a transcript.
