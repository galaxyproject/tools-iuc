    read2tree is a software tool for generating alignment matrices and performing tree inference directly from sequencing reads. It leverages the OMA database and a set of input reads, bypassing many of the standard steps typically required in phylogenomic analysis. In particular, it avoids for read filtering, assembly, gene prediction, gene annotation, all-vs-all comparison, orthology prediction, alignment, and concatenation.
