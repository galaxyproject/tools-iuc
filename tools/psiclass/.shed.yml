    PsiCLASS is a reference-based transcriptome assembler for single or multiple
    RNA-seq samples. Unlik e conventional methods that analyze each sample separately
    and then merge the outcomes to create a unified set of meta-annotations, PsiCLASS
    takes a multi-sample approach, simultaneously analyzing all RNA-seq data sets in
    an experiment.
