    Galaxy Charts is a visualization tool available as plugin for Galaxy.
    Certain chart types like e.g. Histograms, pre-process data before rendering the visualization.
    The pre-processing is done by this tool. Noteworthy, many chart types like e.g. Bar diagrams and Scatterplots, do not require data pre-processing.
