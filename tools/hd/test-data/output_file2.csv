The hamming distances were calculated by comparing each half of all tags against the tag(s) with the minimum Hamming distance per half.
It is possible that one tag can have the minimum HD from multiple tags, so the sample size in this calculation differs from the sample size entered by the user.
actual number of tags with min HD = 79 (sample size by user = 20)
length of one part of the tag = 12

Chimeras:
All tags were filtered: only those tags where at least one half is identical with the half of the min. tag are kept.
So the hamming distance of the non-identical half is compared.
