description: SplicingFactory - splicing diversity analysis of transcript expression matrices
homepage_url: https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/SplicingFactory.html
long_description: |
  Galaxy wrapper for the SplicingFactory R package to calculate gene-level
  splicing diversity from transcript-level expression values. Supports TSV
  matrices, tximport lists, and SummarizedExperiment inputs, and outputs a
  diversity table and an RDS SummarizedExperiment for downstream analyses.
