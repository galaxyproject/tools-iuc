#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
#to use a pre-built lexicmap indexes. You will need to create these
#indexes and then create a lexicmap_index.loc file similar to this
#one (store it in this directory) that points to pre-built indexes.
#The lexicmap_index.loc file has this format 
#(longer white space characters are TAB characters):

#<unique_build_id>   <display_name>   <file_path>
