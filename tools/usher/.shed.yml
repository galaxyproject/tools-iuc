   UShER toolkit
   The UShER toolkit includes a set of tools for for rapid, accurate placement of samples 
   to existing phylogenies. While not restricted to SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analyses, it 
   has enabled real-time phylogenetic analyses and genomic contact tracing in that its 
   placement is orders of magnitude faster and more memory-efficient than previous methods.
