.. class:: infomark

**Purpose**

RIPPLES (Recombination Inference using Phylogenetic PLacEmentS) is a program used to detect recombination events in large mutation annotated tree (MAT) files.

**RIPPLES Common Options**

**Extract**: matUtils extract serves as a flexible prebuilt pipeline, and serves as the primary tool for subsetting and converting a MAT pb to other file formats. 
**Sumary**: matUtils summary is used to get basic statistics and attribute information about the mat. 
**Annotate**: matUtils annotate is a function for adding clade annotation information to the pb.
**Uncertainly**: matUtils uncertainty calculates two specific metrics for sample placement certainty. These metrics can be very important to support contact tracing and reliable identification of the origin of a newly placed sample.
**Mask**: matUtils mask is used to mask specific samples out of the pb, removing their mutations from visibility.
