  The MEME Suite allows the biologist to discover novel motifs in collections of unaligned nucleotide
  or protein sequences, and to perform a wide variety of other motif-based analyses.

  The MEME Suite supports motif-based analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences.  It provides motif
  discovery algorithms using both probabilistic (MEME) and discrete models (MEME), which have complementary
  strengths.  It also allows discovery of motifs with arbitrary insertions and deletions (GLAM2).  In
  addition to motif discovery, the MEME Suite provides tools for scanning sequences for matches to motifs
  (FIMO, MAST and GLAM2Scan), scanning for clusters of motifs (MCAST), comparing motifs to known motifs
  (Tomtom), finding preferred spacings between motifs (SpaMo), predicting the biological roles of motifs
  (GOMo), measuring the positional enrichment of sequences for known motifs (CentriMo), and analyzing
  ChIP-seq and other large datasets (MEME-ChIP).  The MEME Suite is comprised of a collection of tools
  that work together.
