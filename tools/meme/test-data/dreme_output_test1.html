        The name of the motif uses the IUPAC codes for nucleotides which has 
        a different letter to represent each of the 15 possible combinations.
        The name is itself a representation of the motif though the position
        weight matrix is not directly equivalent as it is generated from the
        sites found that matched the letters given in the name.
      <p>The E-value is the enrichment p-value times the number of candidate 
        motifs tested.</p>
      <p>The enrichment p-value is calculated using Fisher's Exact Test for 
        enrichment of the motif in the positive sequences.</p>
      <p>Note that the counts used in Fisher's Exact Test are made after 
        erasing sites that match previously found motifs.</p>
      <p>The E-value of the motif calculated without erasing the sites of 
        previously found motifs.</p>
      <p>Show more information on the motif.</p>
      <p>Submit your motif to another MEME Suite program or download your motif.</p>
