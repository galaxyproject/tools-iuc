long_description: |
    breseq is a computational pipeline for the analysis of short-read re-sequencing data (e.g. Illumina, 454, IonTorrent, etc.). It uses reference-based alignment approaches to predict mutations in a sample relative to an already sequenced genome. breseq is intended for microbial genomes (<10 Mb) and re-sequenced samples that are only slightly diverged from the reference sequence (<1 mutation per 1000 bp).
