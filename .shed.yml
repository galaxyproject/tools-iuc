  Uses the htseq-count script from the Python HTSeq package.
  
  Given a file with aligned sequencing reads and a list of genomic features,
  count how many reads map to each feature.
  
  A feature is defined as an interval
  (i.e., a range of positions) on a chromosome or a union of such intervals.
  
  In the case of RNA-Seq, the features are typically genes, where each gene is defined
  as the union of all it's exons. One may also consider each exon as a feature,
  e.g., in order to check for alternative splicing. For comparative ChIP-Seq, the
  features might be binding regions from a pre-determined list.
