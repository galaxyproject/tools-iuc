**What it does**

Similar to intersectBed, closestBed searches for overlapping features in A and B. In the event that no feature in B overlaps the current feature in A, closestBed will report the closest (that is, least genomic distance from the start or end of A) feature in B. For example, one might want to find which is the closest gene to a significant GWAS polymorphism. Note that closestBed will report an overlapping feature as the closest—that is, it does not restrict to closest non-overlapping feature.
